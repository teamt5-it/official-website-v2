In this session, they introduced the A41APT targeted attack campaign that has been confirmed since March 2019. The attacker's infrastructure and the relevance of this attacker group's attribution to specific APT groups were also discussed.\n\nAs one of the 11 presenters out of 22 candidates, our cyber threat analyst Shui Lee and malware researcher Leon Chang spoke on the third track of the conference, unveiling a new Chinese APT group LuoYo, which hasn't yet been grouped by the public.\n\n<br>\n\n![JSAC_LuoYu.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1613705588/JSAC_Luo_Yu_12e0800310.png)\n_Shui and Leon presented their in-depth analysis of ReverseWindow._\n\nAccording to their speech \"[LuoYu, the Eavesdropper Sneaking in Multiple Platforms](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2021/pdf/JSAC2021_301_shui-leon_en.pdf)\", LuoYo's activity has been observed since 2014, targeting tech companies, media, educational institutions, and other industries in China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This presentation focused on a detailed description on ReverseWindow.

Engineers who analyze and respond to them are required to improve their skills to keep up with the ever-changing techniques of cyber attacks. However, there are few occasions in Japan where techniques and knowledge of incident analysis and response are shared among engineers. Security analysts are expected to get together and exchange their technical expertise on incident handling to develop their strength against cyber attacks both individually and as a whole.\n\nTo achieve this goal, JPCERT/CC hosts Japan Security Analyst Conference (JSAC), the annual conference for exchanging technical information on cyber security incident analysis and response. In this conference, security analysts who handle security incidents on a daily basis are encouraged to share information with each other to deal with ever-evolving cyber attacks today and in the future.\n\nMore information on [JSAC2021](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/en/index.html) event website.\n\n<br>\n","title":"Japan Security Analyst Conference 2021","__v":0,"id":"602f21abc56e80003f985a21"}],"createdAt":"2021-02-19T02:25:47.430Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-19T03:46:56.283Z","__v":1,"author":{"confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"_id":"5eec3483163518003f86d943","username":"TeamT5 Media Center","email":"mediacenter@example.com","provider":"local","createdAt":"2020-06-19T03:44:03.552Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-20T03:45:49.078Z","__v":0,"role":"5e467d0375f9d7007998aebf","id":"5eec3483163518003f86d943"},"topic":{"category":"news_and_events","_id":"5ecaa043a792d70040a0d8b5","name":"Events","color":"#ddaa33","createdAt":"2020-05-24T16:26:43.623Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.735Z","__v":0,"contents":[{"locale":"en","_id":"5edd65efbf58af004a15412b","text":"Events","createdAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.700Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.700Z","__v":0,"id":"5edd65efbf58af004a15412b"},{"locale":"tw","_id":"5edd65efbf58af004a15412c","text":"活動訊息","createdAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.700Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.700Z","__v":0,"id":"5edd65efbf58af004a15412c"},{"locale":"jp","_id":"5edd65efbf58af004a15412d","text":"イベント","createdAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.700Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-07T22:10:55.700Z","__v":0,"id":"5edd65efbf58af004a15412d"}],"id":"5ecaa043a792d70040a0d8b5"},"banner_img_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/f_auto/v1613705225/JSAC_2021_3afa7733ae.png","publish_date":"2021-02-19T04:00:00.000Z","been_relative_posts":[],"id":"602f21abc56e80003f985a20"}},"__N_SSG":true}
