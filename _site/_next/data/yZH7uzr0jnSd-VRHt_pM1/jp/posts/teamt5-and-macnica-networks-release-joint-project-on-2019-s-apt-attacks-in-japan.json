In this collaborative research, we provide valuable insight into four advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and actors. The full report will first be available in Japanese and can be accessed at Macnica Networks' website.\n \nThe APT groups' highlighted in this joint project were believed to have been launching cyber espionage campaigns elsewhere in the world. To enhance APT defense strategies, we take a closer look at the four APT groups, including DarkHotel, Huapi (BlackTech), Nian (Tick), and one unclassified backdoor LODEINFO. These APT groups have been threatening crucial sectors in Japan, such as government, military and defense, manufacturing, telecommunication, education, media, and etc.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1590655880/APT_Attack_Timeline_2019_2da7de1832.png)\n_The attack timeline of the APT groups' campaigns in Japan in 2019._\n\nMacnica Networks is one of the largest system integrators (SI) in Japan.
