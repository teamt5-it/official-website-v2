<p>The North Korean APT group CloudDragon, also known as Kimsuky, continues to target South Korean governments and organizations. TeamT5 has been actively monitoring this threat actor and we recently discovered CloudDragon abusing VPN zero-day vulnerability to launch a new attack against South Korean entities.</p>
<p>TeamT5 recently discovered two malicious samples circulating in South Korea, and both samples are installers of a newly identified backdoor which we named MemzipRAT. With further investigation, we believe this attack was aiming at a South Korean company in the aerospace sector. The company is part of a top 10 conglomerate in South Korea, whose business includes aerospace, chemicals, financial services, IT, etc. </p>
<p>In fact, CloudDragon has been accused of using VPN vulnerabilities to attack numerous entities recently, including Korean government agencies. According to TeamT5’s threat intelligence, we hold high confidence that the above malware to be follow-up attacks of the disclosed attack campaign conducted by CloudDragon. As the exploitation starts from a popular VPN system, these campaigns might lead to massive attacks and damage in the near future. And TeamT5 will keep taking careful attention to CloudDragon&#39;s recent campaign for it might end up a severe supply chain attack.</p>

<p>TeamT5 recently discovered two installers of a newly identified backdoor which we named MemzipRAT. The backdoor is named after an embedded string &quot;get module from cmd memzip : %d&quot; inside the PE files.</p>
<p>With further investigation, we believe this attack was aiming at a South Korean company in the aerospace sector. The company is part of a top 10 conglomerate in South Korea, whose business includes aerospace, chemicals, financial services, IT, etc.</p>
<p>In fact, CloudDragon has been accused of using VPN vulnerabilities to attack numerous entities, including Korean government agencies [1], recently. It is highly possible that they deployed their new malware by the new vulnerability in this case as well. </p>
<br>

<p>Yet, there are two key factors that might pull the trigger of massive intrusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>VPN vulnerability</p>
<p>The VPN market in 2020 is USD $30 billion worldwide. That is, the market is huge and has multiple players inside. It could be a starting point for actors to infiltrate various corporations not only in South Korea, but to the whole world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sectors involved</p>
<p>As the identified target involved in crucial sectors, such as IT, it has a great chance to affect hundreds of entities in a short period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>We strongly advise everyone to take careful attention to CloudDragon&#39;s recent campaign for it might end up a severe supply chain attack.</p>

        <title>Introducing The Most Profitable Ransomware REvil</title>
        <link>https://teamt5.org/jp/posts/introducing-the-most-profitable-ransomware-revil</link>

        <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 02:30:00 GMT</pubDate>

        <![CDATA[<p>*Image courtesy of <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/security-hacker-web-security-data-5614016/">Pixabay</a></p>
<p>In March 2021, another REvil&#39;s attack was announced. Targeting the computer giant Acer, the actors behind the ransomware asked for 50 million dollars, the highest ransom they have demanded so far. Acer was not the only victim of the notorious ransomware. Debuted in April 2019, REvil has attacked hundreds of high-profile agencies in multiple sectors. In 2020, REvil has earned more than 100 million.[1] In this report, we will introduce the basic profile of REvil and share the techniques they used in operations. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-revil">What is REvil</h2>
<p>REvil, a.k.a Sodinokibi, is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operation deployed by a Russian cybercrime group named GOLD SOUTHFIELD or Pinchy Spider. The group is believed to be based in Russia, as it does not attack organizations in Post-Soviet States, and refuse to cooperate with English speaking cyber criminals.[2] </p>
<p>REvil was highly possible the successor of GandCrab, another notorious ransomware, because of code similarities and REvil&#39;s active operations right after GandCrab&#39;s retirement.[3]</p>

<em>Figure 3: REvil and GandCrab&#39;s similarity on building ransom wallpaper</em></p>
<br>

<p>Numerous campaigns attacking multiple sectors were observed all over the world. The REvil actors has attacked local governments, giant law firms, multinational retailers, etc. The highest ransom they have asked was 42 million for the law firm but was now surpassed by the 50 million Acer attack. (References for the events, please see the end of this page.[4])</p>

<em>Figure 4: The timeline of REvil&#39;s notorious attacks</em></p>
<br>

<h2 id="the-ransomware-as-a-service-model-raas">The Ransomware as a Service model (RaaS)</h2>
<p>The actors of REvil adopt the Ransomware as a Service business model. In this model, Ransomware developers are responsible for development and maintenance of the ransomware, while the groups of cyber criminals, named affiliates in this model, are responsible for accessing victims&#39; system to distribute the ransomware. The business model allows cyber criminals who are not capable of developing their own ransomware to buy the service on dark web and deploy ransomware attack. </p>
<p>Through this model, REvil actors provide REvil or the customized version of REvil to their affiliates. After they successfully breached victims&#39; systems, REvil actors will ask for ransom by themselves, providing the ransom payment link. After the collection of money, their affiliates will receive 60% to 75% of the profit. Moreover, the actors also provide other paid services, such as money laundering assistance for the affiliates. </p>

<br>

<h2 id="tactic-techniques-and-procedures">Tactic, Techniques and Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="initial-access">Initial Access</h3>
<p>For REvil, different affiliates may use different methods for initial access. The ransomware is now distributed primarily through compromised RDP sessions (65%), phishing (16%), and software vulnerabilities (8%).[5] However, a supply chain attack distributing REvil was also observed.</p>
<p>REvils&#39; actors said in an interview that they used brute force attacks to compromise RDP sessions.[1] As for phishing emails, the cyber criminals have once disguised their email as a new booking from &quot;booking.com&quot;. They also exploit vulnerabilities. In fact, REvil&#39;s debut was exploiting the Oracle Weblogic vulnerability, CVE-2019-2725. Moreover, the actors are able to deploy new vulnerabilities after its disclosure. For example, the group used the recent disclosed Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability to access Acer&#39;s system.</p>
<p>The most astounding technique they deployed is supply chain attack. Around June 2019, a WINRAR distributor site in Italy was hacked.[6][7] The software downloaded from the site at that time was not the WINRAR installer but the REvil installer. Although no public announcements showing that any company was infected in this attack, the successful replacement shows that their affiliates were able to deploy a supply chain attack. </p>
<p>Apart from their various method on initial access, the cyber criminals also adopted several unique techniques. For example, REvil used Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange to encrypt files, while other ransomware often used RSA, Salsa20 or AES to do so. This method is more efficient as it used shorter key and is difficult to decrypt. </p>
<br>

<h2 id="the-effective-methods-for-ransom-collection">The Effective Methods for Ransom Collection</h2>
<p>Nowadays, as ransomware attacks become a serious problem, most companies have learned to back up crucial data in case they are hit by a ransomware. However, ransomware actors develop several new methods to ensure that the victims will pay the ransom, including Double-extortion, VoIP calling, and DDoS attack.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Double-extortion&quot;
The actors disclose or sell the data of the company if the company is not willing to pay ransom. This method was first introduced by Maze, another notorious ransomware, and currently almost all ransomware actors have adopted this method, and so as REvil. Starting from January 2020, the group runs their own site &quot;Happy Blog&quot;, where they post data extorted from their victims.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling
In February 2021, they announced that they are now offering Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calling and DDoS attack service for their affiliates to make pressure on their victims.[8] They stated that they will call the media or their victims&#39; business partners, telling them about the attack. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 id="detect-and-defense">Detect and Defense</h2>
<p>For prevention, it is always crucial to be aware of spamming emails. Nowadays, spamming emails is still the most popular and effective method to access victims&#39; computers. </p>
<p>In addition, keep an eye on new exploits and updates is also important. Ransomware groups usually are not capable of discovering 0-day exploits by themselves, but they will exploit the disclosed vulnerabilities and attack those who have not updated their system. Thus, keep computers updated and patched systems immediately after the disclosure is essential for preventing ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the REvil business grows, the actors behind has posted on dark web to recruit more affiliates for their operations. Thus, more attacks from the group is expected. TeamT5 will keep following the ransomware and provide up-to-date information of the notorious ransomware.</p>
<p>To efficiently prevent ransomware attacks, TeamT5 offers a total solution for enterprise protection. Our unique ransomware containment technology is proven to successfully block many types of ransomware, which can detect and stop malicious ransomware immediately. And even restore encrypted files from the backup.</p>

        <title>【Korea Boannews】TeamT5 Announces Latest Attack Trend of "Kimsuky" Group at Black Hat Asia</title>
        <link>https://teamt5.org/jp/posts/teamt5-announces-latest-attack-trend-of-kimsuky-group-at-blackhat-asia</link>

        <pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
        <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>*Image courtesy of <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/asia-21/">Black Hat</a></p>
<p>TeamT5, a Taiwanese cyber threat investigation company, shared the results of a recent study on the North Korean Kimsuky group at the &quot;Black Hat Asia Conference&quot; held in Singapore last week. The Kimsuky group is already widely known and is a group that the US CISA has jointly specified with related organizations such as the FBI, and TeamT5&#39;s research is the industry&#39;s first presentation on Kimsuky this year.</p>
<p>TeamT5 revealed that the Kimsuky group was separated from a single group and divided into two groups, and it seems that each is operated separately for different targets. TeamT5 named them &quot;CloudDragon&quot; and &quot;KimDragon&quot; respectively, and introduced the target countries and hacking tools.</p>
<p>TeamT5 announced for the first time that the Kimsuky group is focusing on supply chain attacks. The target is cryptocurrency, and the digital wallet of the exchange and its owner. To this end, the Kimsuky group uses a wide range of operating system combinations of PC, Android, and iOS. Currently, portal companies are concentrating on cross-authentication of PC and mobile at the same time for user authentication, so that the same malicious code can be operated in different environments.</p>
<p>TeamT5 researchers schematically presented evidence of the involvement of Kimsuky&#39;s group in the domestic cryptocurrency hacking case last October. According to this, it is known that the stolen cryptocurrency was transferred to a Dutch IP address and used for laundry. Even hardware wallets known to be secure appear to have been hacked.</p>
<p>In addition, they also announced that they are mainly targeting fake login-inducing accounts on portal sites such as Daum, Naver, and Google. Users can receive new user credentials update emails through bait files and hacked websites. Even Microsoft Windows update notifications were used in preliminary attacks. University login websites such as University Y, University E, and University D located in Seoul were used for hacking.</p>
<p>It was found that the Kimsuky group shifted its focus to not only PC but also mobile environment attacks. Their so-called &quot;hidden&quot; agents create SMS messages without the knowledge of cell phone victims, send written texts, and upload files. It means that you can do anything with a controlled phone, regardless of the user&#39;s will, such as taking audio or video. If cryptocurrency is stored on a mobile phone or log in through a mobile phone, it can be too easily exposed to hacking.</p>
<p>S&amp;C CEO Han Eun-hye, who is servicing the intelligence information of TeamT5 in Korea, said, &quot;It is time to detect their movements in advance based on a database that has been tracking the activities of individual hacker groups for a long time to deal with cybersecurity.&quot; It is necessary to respond to cyber attacks in the future by acquiring intelligence information specific to Asia from among the intelligence information.”</p>

        <title>APT Threat Landscape of Taiwan in 2020</title>
        <link>https://teamt5.org/jp/posts/apt-threat-landscape-of-taiwan-in-2020</link>

        <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate>
        <description>
        <![CDATA[<p><strong>By TeamT5 CTO Charles Li</strong></p>
<p>2020 was considered to be a year of chaos and disaster. Big events such as the outbreak of COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts escalations in several areas, Brexit, and the U.S. president election, all influenced people around the world. In 2020, TeamT5 continued helping numerous security breaches caused by state sponsored targeted instruction attacks (APT) . In the meantime, TeamT5 intelligence Team proactively tracked APT actors’ new activities. Compared with real world, the cyber world was also full of turmoil in 2020 and many of them are reflections or extensions to events in real world. In this article, we will discuss our observation of APT trends in Taiwan in 2020.</p>
<p>In this article, we will first walk you through some remarkable trends, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution of APT tactic</li>
<li>Supply Chain attack became a primary method in APT attacks</li>
<li>COVID-19 driven cyber attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>We will try to dissect the attacks happened in Taiwan in industrial view and adversarial view, which is a common method in threat intelligence analysis. Last part will be our conclusion and suggestions to respond with APT attacks.</p>
<br>

<h3 id="evolution-of-apt-tactic">Evolution of APT tactic</h3>
<p>In 2020, the most notable APT event in public would be the ransom-attack that strike several energy related companies in May [1]. TeamT5 research shows it to be a well-organized campaign from a notorious Chinese adversary group. Whether financial gain or political deterrence is the real motivation behind the ransom-attack remains a mystery. However, it has marked a milestone of China’s cyber-attacks against Taiwan: Chinese APT have aimed Taiwan for more than 20 years but only limited in cyber espionage operations in the past but the threat actors are now exercising new tactics to evade us.</p>
<p>Another cyber-attack supporting our hypothesis occurred on PTT, the most popular BBS platform in Taiwan. TeamT5 tracked a series of posts related to some scandals, with attempts to uglify Taiwanese governments or military, on PTT in July 2020. The actors abused hopping servers from various countries to hide their footprints. However, TeamT5 intelligence database shows that one of the source IP address was also used by a Chinese APT that has targeted Taiwan for more than ten years. Besides, another private source also verified the same APT group to be the culprit behind the attack.  We consider both events to be indicators of China’s expansion on offensive cyber operations, which we have not observed in the past.</p>
<br>

<h3 id="supply-chain-attack-becoming-a-primary-method-in-apt-attacks">Supply Chain attack becoming a primary method in APT attacks</h3>
<p>Supply chain attack has become a major intrusion method for threat actors in 2020 and TeamT5 had warned such tactic in advance [2]. SolarWinds breach was undoubtedly the most successful story among them. Many high-profile US government agencies, Fortune 500 companies and even cybersecurity vendors were affected. It is so sophisticated that the scope is still uncertain yet. In Taiwan, we also observed at least three waves of similar attacks that infiltrated service providers and further leveraged their products or services to infect more victims. The first two had been published by the Ministry of Justice Bureau (MJIB) of Taiwan in August [3]. The third was still under investigation and the impact could be even bigger. We have seen a significant numbers of government agencies or private corporates in Taiwan being compromised. TeamT5 research shows that at least 3 distinct China nexus group were involved in these operations.</p>
<br>

<h3 id="covid-19-driven-cyber-attacks">COVID-19 driven cyber attacks</h3>
<p>Another interesting phenomenon would be COVID-19 related cyber-attacks. Soon after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, we observed state sponsored actors collecting intelligence for the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, threat actors shifted their focus to chasing COVID-19 vaccine information with the advance of COVID-19 vaccine development. In Taiwan, TeamT5 also intercepted several spear phishing emails using COVID-19 as lure theme or even more campaigns related to healthcare related entities. We believe the trend will continue as long as the COVID-19 pandemic still exists.</p>
<p>TeamT5 Intelligence Team had analyzed around one hundred APT attacks from China in 2020. Our statistic shows government and military agencies are still the biggest target and attacks against them counts for more than 1/4 in total and almost every APT groups that are active in Taiwan are coveting them. This trend has lasted for long since the ultimate goal of Chinese espionage operation is to obtain confidential national information. Information Technology (IT) industry also got attention a lot by APT actors and TeamT5 has observed a dramatical increase of attacks against IT industry. We believe this phenomenon is a result of threat actors’ attempts to abuse supply chain attacks and IT companies are considered to be good hopping points by actors to access various industries.</p>
<p>The third industry being targeted in 2020 is Energy industry and TeamT5 had observed at least attacks from 5 adversary groups. It could be a sign of our adversaries’ ambitions to control our critical industries because they will be top priorities of sabotages in wartime. Education or think tanks have been long ranked as the most attacked victims because they tend to involve in classified research projects hosted by governments or political decision makings. There were several targeted attacks against companies in semiconductor industries. It makes sense since Semiconductor industry is listed as a priority to be fostered by Chinese authority in their thirteen and fourteen Five-Year projects. Cyber espionage was also adopted as a mean to improve their techniques. Healthcare and transportation are also two industries that got coveted by APT actors. As we mentioned in the previous paragraph, COVID-19 could be an incentive for APT actors to attack Healthcare industries. Lastly, we would like to raise a phenomenon TeamT5 observed: There was an adversary group which we called GouShe (a.k.a TroppicTropper, Keyboy) focus on infiltrating Transportation related entities in Taiwan. More than 70% of transportation related cases we observed were from this specific group.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvgomg5gh/image/upload/v1620618167/0510_1_bceb3b6be1.png" alt="0510-1.png">
<em>2020 APT target industries distribution</em></p>
<br>

<p>TeamT5 has tracked activities from at least 9 APT groups and 8 of them are from China. HUAPI (a.k.a BlackTech/PLEAD) was definitely the most ambitious group in Taiwan. Their attacks counts around 30% of incidents we analyzed and the targeting scope includes almost all the industries we listed. The supply chain attacks we mentioned in previous paragraphs were also conducted by them. APT27 (a.k.a EmissaryPanda, IronTiger, LuckyMouse, BronzeUnion), GouShe and AMOEBA (a.k.a APT41, Barium, Winnti) are groups that are quite active in 2020. APT27 was mostly attacking government, healthcare, and financial entities. GouShe showed a peculiar interest in transportation related entities while their footprints are also observed in energy and government entities. TeamT5 has tracked this group for many years. Our research shows that the actors might bear some responsibility from their higher commands to monitor some critical infrastructure facilities in Taiwan and take control of them in case of emergency status.</p>
<p>AMOEBA attacked energy companies, semiconductor companies, educational institutes, and IT companies. Their primary goal appears to be more for intellectual property or secret theft. But the possibilities exist that the actor might further leverage their achievement, like what they did in the ransom-attack in May. SLIME1, SLIME9 and SLIME13 are temporary code names for three Chinese APT campaigns against Taiwan that have lasted for a few years. Their activities still continued in 2020. Polaris (a.k.a MustangPanda) is another Chinese APT group that attacked almost all neighboring countries of China. We intercepted several of their spear phishing emails against government and research institutes in early stage of COVID-19 and we surmise they were gathering for information related to pandemic. One last interesting discovery: we discovered some Linux based malware used by Lazarus, a notorious North Korean APT group, circulated in Taiwan but we are unable to obtain the victim identity information. Although Taiwan is not a primary target of North Korean APT. But the Lazarus actors are believed to bear financial supporting responsibilities for their government agencies. For example, Lazarus is believed to be the culprit behind a Taiwanese bank SWIFT heist in 2017 [4]. The sample we uncovered might suggest their activities still exist in Taiwan.</p>

<em>Adversaries attacking Taiwan in 2020</em></p>
<br>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
